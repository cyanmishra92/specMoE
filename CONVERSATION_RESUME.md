## What We Accomplished

### 🧹 **Codebase Cleanup (COMPLETED)**
1. ✅ **Moved 24+ broken/experimental scripts** to `archive_unused/`
2. ✅ **Organized working scripts** into proper directories:
   - `scripts/collection/` - Working data collectors (128-expert)
   - `scripts/training/` - Proper train/test scripts  
   - `scripts/evaluation/` - Individual testing & comparison
   - `scripts/pipelines/` - Complete working pipeline
3. ✅ **Updated documentation** - New README, Quick Start, Install Guide
4. ✅ **Created conda environment setup** - Complete dependencies

### 🎯 **Ready-to-Use Pipeline**
Your **original working scripts** are now properly organized:
- ✅ `scripts/collection/collect_robust_traces.py` - 128-expert Switch Transformer
- ✅ `scripts/training/proper_train_test.py` - Robust training with no data leakage
- ✅ `scripts/evaluation/test_individual_approaches.py` - All speculation algorithms
- ✅ `scripts/evaluation/compare_all_approaches.py` - Comprehensive comparison
- ✅ `scripts/pipelines/run_working_pipeline.py` - Complete automation

### 📊 **Current Data Status**
- ✅ **6,000 routing traces** in `routing_data/proper_traces.pkl` (188 MB)
- ✅ **Trained models** in `trained_models/`
- ✅ **GPU ready** (0.8% usage - idle)

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Fresh Testing**

### 1. Setup New Environment
```bash
# In new directory
./setup_conda_env.sh
conda activate specmoe
```

### 2. Test Working Pipeline
```bash
# Quick test (no 128-expert)
python scripts/pipelines/run_working_pipeline.py

# Full test (128-expert - YOUR ORIGINAL SETUP)
python scripts/pipelines/run_working_pipeline.py --use-128-experts
```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- **128-expert collection**: Will take 10-30 minutes (large model)
- **Training**: Uses proper data splits, no overfitting
- **Testing**: All speculation algorithms
- **Comparison**: Comprehensive results

## 🔧 **Files Created for Fresh Setup**
- ✅ `setup_conda_env.sh` - Complete conda environment setup
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
- ✅ `INSTALL_GUIDE.md` - Fresh installation guide
- ✅ `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 **Resume Context**

**Problem Solved**: Your previous pipeline was working, but I accidentally broke it during refactoring. 

**Solution**: Restored your original working scripts and organized them properly:
1. Found your 128-expert collector in archive
2. Found your working training/testing scripts
3. Organized everything cleanly
4. Created fresh setup for testing

**Key Working Scripts**:
- `collect_robust_traces.py` - Uses `google/switch-base-128` 
- `proper_train_test.py` - Has robust train/test splits
- All evaluation and comparison scripts

**Test Command**:
```bash
python scripts/pipelines/run_working_pipeline.py --use-128-experts
```

## 📝 **What to Tell Claude When You Return**

"I'm back! Please help me test the cleaned codebase in a fresh directory. I want to run the 128-expert speculation pipeline from scratch using the working scripts you organized."

The codebase is now **clean, organized, and ready** with your original working 128-expert pipeline properly structured!
