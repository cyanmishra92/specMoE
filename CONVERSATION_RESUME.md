# Comprehensive Speculation Training - Conversation Resume

## Date: 2025-07-11

## Context Summary

We've built a comprehensive training script that combines ALL archived model types from the specMoE research project. This represents the culmination of all speculation research approaches.

## What We Accomplished Today

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Analyzed Archive Directory** - Found 25+ archived scripts with different model approaches
2. **Extracted All Model Architectures** from archived implementations:
   - Attention-based models (Contextual, Transformer, Hierarchical)
   - Ensemble methods (Layer-specific, Hierarchical ensemble)
   - Multi-scale feature models
   - Edge-optimized models (Tiny, Small, Regularized)
   - Switch Transformer integration
   - Sequence models with LSTM/Transformer encoders

3. **Created Comprehensive Training Script** (`scripts/training/comprehensive_speculation_training.py`)
   - **9 different model architectures** in one script
   - **Model-specific optimizations** (learning rates, epochs, batch sizes)
   - **Advanced training strategies** (label smoothing, gradient clipping, early stopping)
   - **Comprehensive evaluation** with category analysis

## Model Types Included

### üß† Attention-Based Models

## Current State

### Files Created/Modified
- ‚úÖ `scripts/training/comprehensive_speculation_training.py` - Complete training script
- ‚úÖ `CONVERSATION_RESUME.md` - This resume file

### Ready to Run
The comprehensive training script is ready to execute:

```bash
python scripts/training/comprehensive_speculation_training.py
```

### Expected Outputs
- **9 trained models** saved to `trained_models/` directory
- **Comprehensive results** in JSON format with timestamp
- **Performance comparison** across all model categories
- **Category analysis** showing best approaches
- **Training time and efficiency metrics**

## What to Do Tomorrow

### üöÄ Immediate Next Steps
1. **Run the comprehensive training script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/training/comprehensive_speculation_training.py
   ```

2. **Monitor training progress** - Should take ~2-3 hours for all 9 models

3. **Analyze results**:
   - Check which model category performs best
   - Compare parameter efficiency vs accuracy
   - Identify best models for different use cases

### üìä Follow-up Analysis
1. **Create visualizations** of the results
2. **Performance vs efficiency plots**
3. **Layer-wise accuracy analysis**
4. **Inference speed benchmarking**

### üî¨ Potential Extensions
1. **Hyperparameter tuning** for best models
2. **Model ensembling** of top performers
3. **Quantization** for edge deployment
4. **Real-world inference testing**

## Data Requirements

### Current Setup
- **Traces file**: `routing_data/robust_traces.pkl`
- **Expected format**: GatingDataPoint objects with hidden_states, target_routing, prev_layer_gates
- **Data splits**: 52.5% train, 17.5% val, 30% test (proper sample-level splitting)

### GPU Requirements
- **Memory**: ~8-12GB VRAM for attention models
- **Compute**: RTX 3090 or equivalent recommended
- **Training time**: ~15-30 minutes per model (total: 2-3 hours)

## Model Architecture Summary

The script implements a progression from simple edge models to sophisticated attention-based architectures:
