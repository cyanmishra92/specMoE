| 8 | 24.4% | 24.4% | 0.508 |
| 16 | 34.8% | 34.8% | 0.637 |
| 32 | 49.1% | 49.1% | 0.768 |
| 64 | 64.9% | 64.9% | 0.876 |

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Implement Expert Deduplication
- **Memory Impact**: Reduce expert loading by up to 80% for large batches
- **Bandwidth Impact**: Decrease CPU↔GPU transfers proportionally
- **Implementation**: Group unique expert IDs before loading

### 2. Batch Size Optimization
- **Optimal batch sizes**: 64+ for maximum deduplication benefits
- **Trade-off**: Balance memory savings vs computational overhead

### 3. Locality-Aware Scheduling
- **Benefit**: Higher locality factors increase deduplication effectiveness
- **Strategy**: Group similar requests within batches when possible

## Implementation Example

```python
def deduplicate_expert_requests(batch_requests):
    # Flatten all expert requests
    all_experts = []
    for item_experts in batch_requests:
        all_experts.extend(item_experts)
    
    # Get unique experts
    unique_experts = list(set(all_experts))
    
    # Load only unique experts once
    for expert_id in unique_experts:
        load_expert(expert_id)
    
    return unique_experts
```

## Technical Analysis

### Memory Efficiency Formula
```
Memory Savings = (Total Requests - Unique Requests) / Total Requests
Bandwidth Savings = Expert Size × (Total Transfers - Unique Transfers)
```

### Observed Patterns
- **Linear scaling**: Savings increase with batch size
- **Locality dependence**: Higher locality → better deduplication
- **Expert count impact**: More experts per item → higher potential savings
