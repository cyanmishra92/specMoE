medium_features = self.process_context_scale(context, length=3) 
long_features = self.process_context_scale(context, length=4)

# Learned scale importance
scale_weights = torch.softmax(self.scale_weights, dim=0)

- **Mixup**: Probabilistic sequence blending
- **Noise Injection**: Embedding perturbation during training

**Unique Innovation**: Expert-aware augmentation
```python
def expert_permutation_augment(self, expert_seq, target_seq):
    # Maintain routing patterns under expert relabeling
    perm = torch.randperm(128)  # Random expert permutation
    return perm[expert_seq], perm[target_seq]
```

**Expected Impact**: Strong generalization improvement

```python
# Weight by validation performance
weights = [model_acc / total_acc for model_acc in individual_accs]
ensemble_pred = sum(w * model(x) for w, model in zip(weights, models))
```

**Expected Impact**: Robust accuracy with uncertainty quantification
