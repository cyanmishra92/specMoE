## 🎯 Step-by-Step Usage

### Option 1: Complete Automated Pipeline

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline (recommended)
python run_speculation_pipeline.py

# Or run specific steps
python run_speculation_pipeline.py --steps 1 2    # Just collect and train
python run_speculation_pipeline.py --steps 3 4 5  # Just test and evaluate
```

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Collect Training Data
```bash
# Collect routing traces from real MoE models
python collect_real_traces.py
```

#### Step 2: Train Speculation Models  
```bash
# Train learnable gating models on collected traces
python train_with_real_traces.py
```

#### Step 3: Test Models
```bash
# Test the learned speculation models
python test_learnable_speculation.py
```

#### Step 4: Run Applications
```bash
# Test custom model with learnable speculation
python main.py --mode demo --speculation-mode learnable

# Compare all speculation modes
python main.py --mode compare

# Test pre-trained Switch Transformer
python main_pretrained.py --mode demo --pretrained-model google/switch-base-8
```

## 🧠 Speculation Modes Available

| Mode | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `none` | No speculation (baseline) | ✅ Working |
| `layer_minus_1` | Simple previous layer prediction | ✅ Working |
| `multi_layer` | Multi-layer history (default) | ✅ Working |
| `adaptive` | Confidence-based adaptation | ✅ Working |
| `learnable` | **Trained neural models** | 🆕 **NEW!** |

## 📊 Expected Results

### After Training (Step 2)
```
🧠 Training Results:
✅ contextual_real_data.pt
✅ transformer_real_data.pt  
✅ hierarchical_real_data.pt

Training Stats: 30% loss reduction (1.82 → 1.27)
```

### After Testing (Step 4)
```
🎯 Speculation Mode Comparison:
Mode            Time (ms)    Tokens/sec   Accuracy   Cache Hit
none            45.2         566          0.000      0.125
multi_layer     42.1         608          0.132      0.234
learnable       41.8         612          0.XXX      0.XXX
```

## 🔧 Current Data Status

Based on the status check, you currently have:
- ✅ **6,000 routing traces** in `proper_traces.pkl` (188 MB)
- ✅ **Trained models** ready for use
- ✅ **Low GPU usage** (0.8%) - ready for training/testing

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No trained models found"
**Solution:** Run training first
```bash
python train_with_real_traces.py
```

### Issue: "Trace file not found"  
**Solution:** Collect traces first
```bash
python collect_real_traces.py
```

### Issue: GPU memory errors
**Solution:** Reduce batch size in scripts or use CPU fallback

### Issue: Import errors
**Solution:** Install dependencies
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets numpy tqdm
```
