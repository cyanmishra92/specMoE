### 🎯 Ready-to-Use Commands

**Complete Pipeline (Recommended):**
```bash
python scripts/pipelines/run_working_pipeline.py --use-128-experts
```

**Individual Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Collect 128-expert traces
python scripts/collection/collect_robust_traces.py

# 2. Train with proper splits  
python scripts/training/proper_train_test.py

# 3. Test approaches
python scripts/evaluation/test_individual_approaches.py

# 4. Compare all
python scripts/evaluation/compare_all_approaches.py
```

**Demo Applications:**
```bash
python main.py --mode demo --speculation-mode multi_layer
python main_pretrained.py --mode demo
```

## 🧹 What Was Cleaned

### ✅ Moved to `archive_unused/` (24 files)
- ❌ Broken pipeline scripts (`run_speculation_pipeline.py`)
- ❌ Failed training scripts (`train_with_real_traces.py`) 
- ❌ Experimental collectors with issues
- ❌ Debug scripts and old experiments
- ❌ Old result files and logs

### ✅ Organized Working Scripts (5 files)
- ✅ `collect_robust_traces.py` → `scripts/collection/`
- ✅ `proper_train_test.py` → `scripts/training/`
- ✅ `test_individual_approaches.py` → `scripts/evaluation/`
- ✅ `compare_all_approaches.py` → `scripts/evaluation/`
- ✅ `run_working_pipeline.py` → `scripts/pipelines/`

### ✅ Kept Core Framework (Unchanged)
- ✅ `models/`, `gating/`, `training/`, `memory/`, `utils/`
- ✅ `main.py`, `main_pretrained.py`
- ✅ All data directories and trained models

## 📊 Current Data Status

- ✅ **6,000 routing traces** in `routing_data/proper_traces.pkl` (188 MB)
- ✅ **Trained models** in `trained_models/` 
- ✅ **GPU ready** (0.8% usage - idle)
- ✅ **All imports working** after reorganization

## 🎉 What's Working Now

1. **Clean Structure**: Easy to navigate and understand
2. **Working Scripts**: Only proven, functional scripts in main directories
3. **Clear Documentation**: Updated README and quick start guide
4. **Organized Results**: All outputs in `results/` directory
5. **Archive Safety**: All experimental code preserved in `archive_unused/`

## 🚀 Next Steps

The codebase is now **production-ready**:

1. **Test the pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pipelines/run_working_pipeline.py --use-128-experts
   ```

2. **Use working components**:
   - All scripts in `scripts/` are the original working versions
   - Core framework (`models/`, `gating/`, etc.) unchanged
   - Demo applications ready to use

3. **Development**:
   - Add new features to organized directories
   - Use `archive_unused/` for reference
   - Follow the clean structure for new scripts

The cleanup resolved the issues by:
- ✅ Removing broken/experimental code from main directories
- ✅ Restoring proven working scripts to proper locations
- ✅ Organizing everything for easy navigation and use
- ✅ Maintaining all existing data and models
