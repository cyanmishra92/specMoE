### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Different Performance Characteristics:**

1. **Routing Density Impact**:
   ```
   Expert Access Patterns:
   ├── Switch: 1 expert/token → concentrated cache pressure  
   ├── Qwen: 8 experts/token → distributed cache pressure
   └── Result: Qwen requires larger cache for same hit rates
   ```

2. **Architecture Trade-offs**:
   - **Switch**: Sparse activation enables aggressive caching optimization
   - **Qwen**: Dense activation (top-8) creates different optimization landscape
   - **Cache Pressure**: 8× higher in Qwen due to multi-expert requirements

3. **Optimization Potential**:
   - **Switch**: High optimization ceiling due to sparse patterns
