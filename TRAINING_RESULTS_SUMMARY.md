# üéØ Gating Model Training Results Summary

## üìã Overview

We have successfully implemented and trained **learnable gating models** for pre-gated MoE speculation, moving beyond simple heuristics to neural networks that learn routing patterns from real MoE behavior.

## üîç Key Findings

### **Baseline Heuristic Performance (Before Training)**
Our initial analysis revealed significant limitations in heuristic-based speculation:

```
                   Top-1 Acc  Top-2 Acc  KL Divergence
Layer-Minus-1      12.0%      26.6%      0.353
Multi-Layer        13.2%      25.2%      0.339  (Best)
Pattern Learning   12.0%      26.8%      0.364
Adaptive           9.6%       25.4%      0.364
```

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- **Poor Accuracy**: 10-13% top-1 accuracy barely beats random (12.5% for 8 experts)
- **No Confidence Calibration**: NaN confidence correlations indicate broken calibration
- **Cold Start Problem**: No historical data initially, predictions essentially random
- **Synthetic Data Mismatch**: Using random gate scores instead of real routing patterns

### **Root Cause Analysis**
You correctly identified the core issue: **"We have not trained the gating models"**. Our heuristic approaches were fundamentally limited because they lacked:

1. **Training on Real Data**: No exposure to actual MoE routing patterns
2. **Learnable Components**: No neural components to capture complex routing dependencies
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Missing input features beyond basic routing history

## üß† Learnable Gating Implementation

### **Training Data Collection**
We implemented a comprehensive data collection pipeline:

- **Real MoE Routing Capture**: Hooks to extract routing decisions from trained models
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Fallback using our custom SmallSwitchTransformer
- **Rich Context Features**: Hidden states, previous layer routing, attention patterns
- **30 Training Samples Generated**: Successfully collected routing patterns

### **Neural Architecture Design**
We implemented **three different learnable architectures**:

1. **ContextualGatingPredictor**
   - Multi-head attention for routing pattern analysis
   - Context encoding from previous 3-4 layers
   - Confidence prediction head
   - Feature fusion with position encoding

2. **TransformerGatingPredictor** 
   - Sequence-to-sequence modeling with transformer encoder
   - LSTM for routing history encoding
   - Layer embeddings for position awareness

3. **HierarchicalGatingPredictor**
   - Token-level + sequence-level predictions
   - Weighted combination of granularities
   - Adaptive fusion weights

### **Masked Training Approach**
Implemented sophisticated training methodology:

- **Masked Language Modeling Style**: Predict routing for masked tokens
- **Multiple Loss Components**:
  - Routing prediction loss (cross-entropy)
  - Confidence calibration loss (BCE)
  - Consistency loss (adjacent token similarity)
  - Diversity loss (encourage uniform expert usage)
- **Device Optimization**: RTX 3090 specific configurations
