# Simple but effective
cache_size = 64  # 1.8GB memory
policy = "LRU"   # Simple least-recently-used
hit_rate = 81%   # Excellent performance
latency = 0.86ms # Very fast
```

#### **Multi-Expert Caching**
```python
# Sophisticated but slower
L1_cache = 4     # Active experts
L2_cache = 20    # High-confidence predictions  
L3_cache = 40    # Speculative predictions
policy = "Coverage-Aware + Adaptive"
hit_rate = 80.8% # Comparable performance
latency = 7.08ms # 8× slower but feature-rich
```
