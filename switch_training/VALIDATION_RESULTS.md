## üîß Technical Insights

### Stabilization Techniques That Worked

1. **Router Weight Scaling**: Reduced initial router weights by 100x
2. **FP32 Training**: Avoided mixed precision instabilities
3. **Conservative Learning Rates**: 1e-5 to 1e-6 range optimal
4. **Gradient Clipping**: 0.1 threshold prevented exploding gradients
5. **Data Filtering**: Ultra-safe ASCII-only filtering prevented tokenization issues

### Common Issues Encountered

1. **NaN Loss**: Solved with router stabilization and lower learning rates
2. **Early Stopping**: Too aggressive patience (3) caused undertraining
3. **Multi-GPU Problems**: A6000 peer mapping issues required single GPU
4. **Memory Issues**: Large models need careful batch size tuning
5. **Generation Quality**: Undertrained models produce gibberish

### Best Practice Configuration

Based on experiments, the optimal configuration for RTX 3090:

```bash
python train_switch_stabilized.py \
  --model_name google/switch-base-8 \
  --batch_size 2 \
  --learning_rate 1e-5 \
  --num_epochs 5 \
  --patience 10 \
  --max_length 256
```

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Model | Parameters | Perplexity | Quality | Training Time | Status |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Small MoE | 238M | 70.2 | Poor | 18 min | ‚úÖ Stable |
| Switch-8 (v1) | 619M | 246.4 | Very Poor | 3 min | ‚ùå Undertrained |

## üéØ Key Learnings

### Model Architecture Insights

1. **Switch Transformers are sensitive**: Require very careful hyperparameter tuning
2. **MoE routing is fragile**: Router weight initialization critical for stability
3. **Seq2seq complexity**: More complex than causal LM models to train and evaluate
4. **Scale benefits**: Larger models (switch-base-16) need more stable hardware setup

### Training Strategy Insights

1. **Conservative is better**: Lower learning rates more reliable than aggressive training
2. **Patience matters**: Early stopping patience should be 8-10 for fine-tuning
3. **Data quality > quantity**: 3,253 clean samples better than 7,777 noisy ones
4. **Single GPU safer**: Multi-GPU introduces unnecessary complexity

### Hardware Considerations

1. **RTX 3090**: Suitable for switch-base-8 with batch_size=2
2. **A6000**: Can handle switch-base-16 but needs single GPU configuration
3. **Memory scaling**: Each expert adds significant memory overhead
4. **Cooling important**: Long training runs benefit from better cooling

## üîÆ Future Directions

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete A6000 training**: Fix multi-GPU issues and train switch-base-16
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Test different learning rate schedules
3. **Data augmentation**: Expand beyond 16 papers for better coverage
4. **Evaluation refinement**: Improve seq2seq evaluation methodology

### Advanced Experiments

1. **Expert specialization analysis**: Study which experts activate for different content
2. **Routing pattern visualization**: Understand expert selection patterns
3. **Larger scale training**: Test switch-base-32 on A100 hardware
4. **Cross-domain evaluation**: Test on papers from different research areas

### Methodology Improvements

1. **Better data preprocessing**: Less aggressive filtering while maintaining quality
2. **Curriculum learning**: Start with easier tasks and increase complexity
3. **Multi-stage training**: Pre-train on general text, fine-tune on research papers
4. **Ensemble methods**: Combine multiple expert configurations
