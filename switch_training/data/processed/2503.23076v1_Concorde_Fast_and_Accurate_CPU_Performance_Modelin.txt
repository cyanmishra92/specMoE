We present Concorde, a new methodology for learningfastandaccurateperformancemodelsofmicroarchitectures. Unlike existing simulators and learning approaches that emulate each instruction, Concorde predicts the behavior of a program based on compact performance distributions that capture the impact of dif- ferent microarchitectural components. It derives these performance distributions using simple analytical models that estimate bounds on performance induced by each microarchitectural component, pro- viding a simple yet rich representation of a program s performance characteristics across a large space of microarchitectural parameters. Experiments show that Concorde is more than five orders of mag- nitude faster than a reference cycle-level simulator, with about 2 average Cycles-Per-Instruction (CPI) prediction error across a range of SPEC, open-source, and proprietary benchmarks. This enables rapid design-space exploration and performance sensitivity analyses that are currently infeasible, e.g., in about an hour, we conducted a first-of-its-kind fine-grained performance attribution to different microarchitectural components across a diverse set of programs, requiring nearly 150 million CPI evaluations. 1 Introduction Microarchitecture simulators are a key tool in the computer archi- tect sarsenal[4,6,11,14,19,28,72,75,82].FromSimpleScalar[11]to gem5 [14, 59], simulators have enabled architects to explore new de- signs and optimize existing ones without the prohibitive costs of fab- rication. CPU simulation, in particular, has become increasingly im- portant as hyperscale companies like Google (Axion) [85], Amazon (Graviton) [7], Microsoft (Cobalt) [62] increasingly invest in devel- oping custom CPU architectures tailored to their specific workloads. The landscape of CPU performance modeling is characterized by a critical tension between model accuracy and speed. This trade-off manifests in the various levels of abstraction employed by different performance models [14, 32, 87]. At one end of the spectrum lie analytical models [2, 87], which provide simplified mathematical representations of microarchitectural components and their inter- actions. Although they are fast, analytical models often lack the detailed modeling necessary to capture the dynamics of modern pro- cessorsaccurately.Attheotherendofthespectrumresidecycle-level simulators like gem5 [14], which can provide high-fidelity results by meticulously modeling every cycle of execution. However, this level Work done at Google. of detail comesat a steep computational cost, becoming prohibitively slow for large-scale design space exploration [32, 47, 55], programs with billions of instructions, or detailed sensitivity studies. Recognizing the limitations of conventional methods, there has been growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to expedite CPU simulation [54, 55, 61, 71]. Rather than explicitly model ev- ery cycle and microarchitectural interaction, these methods learn an approximate model of the architecture s performance from a large corpus of data. A typical approach is to pose the problem as learning a function mapping a sequence of instructions to the tar- get performance metrics. For example, recent work [50, 54, 55, 71] train sequence models (e.g., LSTMs [35] and Transformers [88]) on ground-truth data from a cycle-level simulator to predict metrics such as the program s Cycles Per Instruction (CPI). These methods show promise in providing fast performance esti- mates with reasonable accuracy. However, relying on black-box ML models operating on instruction sequences has several limitations. First, the computational cost of these methods scales proportionally with the length of the instruction sequence, i.e. O(𝐿) where 𝐿is the instruction sequence length. The O(𝐿) complexity limits the potential speedup of these methods, e.g., to less than 10 faster than cycle-level simulation with a single GPU [55, 71]. This speedup is mainlyduetoreplacingtheirregularcomputationsofcycle-levelsim- ulation with accelerator-friendly neural network calculations [71]. By contrast, analytical models can be several orders of magnitude faster than cycle-level simulation (and current ML approaches) be- cause they fundamentally operate at a higher level of abstraction, i.e., mathematical expressions relating key statistics (e.g., instruction mix, cache behavior, branch misprediction rate, etc.) to performance. Second, existing ML approaches must learn all the dynamics im- pacting performance from raw instruction-level training data. In many cases, this learning task is unnecessarily complex since it does not exploit the CPU performance modeling problem structure. For example, TAO s Transformer model [71] must learn the perfor- mance impact of register dependencies from per-instruction register information, even though there exist higher-level abstractions (e.g., instruction dependency graphs [61]) that concisely represent depen- dency behavior ( 3.2). By ignoring the problem structure, blackbox methodsrequireasignificantamountoftrainingdatatolearn.Forex- ample, TAO trains on a dataset of 180 million instructions across four benchmarks and two microarchitectures [71], with further training required for each new microarchitecture. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to per- formance modeling compositional analytical-ML fusion where we decompose the task into multiple lightweight models that work 1 arXiv:2503.23076v1 [cs.AR] 29 Mar 2025 A. Nasr-Esfahany et al. together to progressively achieve high fidelity with low computa- tionalcomplexity.WedemonstratethisapproachinConcorde,aCPU performance model that uses simple analytical models capturing the first-order effects of individual microarchitectural components, cou- pled with an ML model that captures complex higher-order effects (e.g., interactions of multiple microarchitectural components). Concorde achieves constant-time O(1) inference complexity, in- dependent of the length of the instruction stream, while maintaining high accuracy across diverse workloads and microarchitectures. Un- like existing ML methods that operate on instruction sequences, Concorde predicts performance based on a compact set of perfor- mance distributions. It trains a lightweight ML model a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map these performance distribu- tions to the target performance metric. We focus on modeling CPI in thispaperasitdirectlyreflectsprogramperformance,thoughinprin- ciple our techniques could be extended to other metrics. Concorde s ML model generalizes across a large space of designs, specified via a set of parameters associated with different microarchitectural com- ponents ( 3). Given the performance distributions for a program region (e.g., 1M instructions), predicting its CPI on any target mi- croarchitecture is extremely fast; it requires only a single neural network evaluation, taking less than a millisecond. Concorde derives a program region s performance distributions through a two-step process: trace analysis and analytical modeling. Trace analysis uses simple in-order cache and branch predictor sim- ulators to extract information such as instruction dependencies, ap- proximate execution latencies, and branch misprediction rate. Next, analytical models estimate the bottleneck throughput imposed by each CPU component (e.g., fetch buffer, load queue, etc.) in isolation, assuming other CPU components have infinite capacity. For each CPU component, Concorde uses the distribution of its throughput bound over windows of a few hundred instructions as its perfor- mance feature. For each memory configuration, Concorde executes the per-component analytical models independently to precompute the set of performance distributions for all parameter values. The analytical models are lightweight, completing in 10s of milliseconds for a million instructions. Precomputing the performance distribu- tions is a one-time cost, enabling nearly instantaneous performance predictions across the entire parameter space. Concorde s unique division of labor between analytical and ML modeling simplifies both the analytical and ML models. Since the an- alytical models are not directly used to predict performance, they are relatively easy to construct. Their main goal is to provide a first-cut estimate of the performance bounds associated with each microar- chitectural component (akin to roofline analysis [18]), without the burden of quantifying the combined effect of multiple interacting components. The ML model, on the other hand, starts with features that correlate strongly with a program s performance, rather than raw instruction sequences. Its task is to capture the higher-order effects ignored by the analytical models, such as the impact of multi- ple interacting bottlenecks. The net result is a method that is as fast as analytical models while achieving high accuracy. Concorde enables large-scale analyses that are deemed imprac- tical with conventional methods. As one use case, we consider the problem of fine-grained performance attribution to different mi- croarchitectural components: What is the relative contribution of different microarchitectural components to the predicted performance of a target architecture? We present a novel technique for answering thisquestionusingonlyaperformancemodelrelatingmicroarchitec- tural parameters to performance. Our technique applies the concept of Shapley value [78] from cooperative game theory to provide a fair and rigorous attribution of performance to individual components. The method improves upon standard parameter ablation studies and may be of interest in other use cases beyond Concorde. We present a concrete realization of Concorde, designed to ap- proximate the behavior of a proprietary gem-5 based cycle-level trace-driven CPU simulator. We train Concorde on a dataset of 1 mil- lionrandomprogramregionsandarchitectures,topredicttheimpact of 20 parameters spanning frontend, backend, and memory (total- ing 2.2 1023 parameter combinations). The program regions are sampled from a diverse set of SPEC2017 [40], open-source, and pro- prietary benchmarks. The key findings of our evaluation are: Concorde saverageCPIpredictionerroriswithin2 oftheground- truth cycle-level simulator for unseen (random) program regions and architectures, with only 2.5 of samples exceeding a 10 pre- diction error. Ignoring the one-time cost of analytical modeling, Concorde is five orders of magnitude faster for predicting the performance of 1M-instruction regions. For long 1B instruction programs, Concorde accurately estimates performance (average error 3.2 ) based on randomly-sampled program regions, seven- orders of magnitude faster than cycle-level simulation. InpredictingCPIforarealisticcoremodel(basedonARMN1[73]), Concorde is more accurate than TAO [71], the state-of-the-art sequence-based ML performance model, trained specifically for the same core configuration. It achieves an average prediction error of 3.5 , compared to 7.8 for TAO. For a 1M-instruction region, precomputing all the performance distributions takes the CPU time equivalent of 7 to 107 cycle-level simulations, depending on the granularity of parameter sweeps. Theseperformancefeaturesenablerapidperformancepredictions for 1.8 1018 to 2.2 1023 parameter combinations. Concorde enables a first of its kind, large-scale, fine-grained per- formance attribution to components of a core based on ARM N1, across a diverse set of programs using our Shapley value tech- nique. This large-scale analyses requires more than 143M CPI evaluations, but takes only about one hour with Concorde. 2 Motivation and Insights Consider a cycle-level simulator like gem5 as implementing a func- tion that maps an input program and microarchitecture configura- tion to a performance metric such as CPI. Formally,𝑦 𝑓( x, p), where x (𝑥1,...,𝑥𝐿) denotes the input program comprising 𝐿instructions, p (𝑝1,...,𝑝𝑑) the parameters specifying the microarchitecture, and 𝑦the CPI achieved by program x on microarchitecture p. Our goal is to learn a fast and accurate approximation of the function 𝑓from training examples derived from cycle-level simulations. Supervised learning provides the de facto framework for learning a function from input-output examples. However, a critical design decision involves how to best represent the learning problem, in- cluding the selection of representative features and an appropriate model architecture. Several recent efforts [54, 55, 71] represent the function 𝑓using sequence-based models, such as LSTMs [35] and 2 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion Instruction ID 1 2 3 IPC A (Timeseries) Instruction ID B (Timeseries) ROB Load queue Maximum icache fills Decode width Ground truth IPC 1 2 3 IPC 0 100 CDF ( ) A (Distributions) 1 2 3 IPC B (Distributions) Figure 1: Per-resource analytical modeling produces a rich perfor- mance characterization of a program. Transformers [88], operating on raw or minimally processed in- struction sequences. As discussed in 1, these blackbox sequence models inherently limit scalability and increase the complexity of the learning task. Our key insight is a novel decomposition of the function 𝑓, comprising of two key stages. First, an analytical stage uses simple per-component models to extract compact performance features capturing the overall performance characteristics of the program. Second, a lightweight ML model predicts the target CPI metric efficiently based on these performance features. Deriving compact performance features. The foundation of our analytical stage is to characterize the bottleneck throughput im- posed by each CPU resource1 individually, under the simplifying assumption that all other CPU components operate with unlimited capacity. For instance, to analyze the impact of the reorder buffer (ROB) size, we evaluate the program s throughput in a hypothetical system constrained only by the ROB size and instruction dependen- cies (i.e., a perfect frontend with no backend resource bottlenecks other than the limited ROB size). Focusing on one resource at a time enables relatively straightforward analyses (see 3.2 for examples). Formally, given a program x, we compute the bottleneck throughput 𝑧𝑖 𝐴𝑖( x,𝑝𝑖) for each CPU component, where 𝐴𝑖( , ) is the analyt- ical model for the 𝑖th component, parameterized by 𝑝𝑖. To capture programphasechanges,wecalculatethisthroughputoversmallwin- dows of consecutive instructions (e.g., a few hundred instructions). Figure 1 shows an illustrative example of these throughput calcu- lationsforfourmicroarchitecturalparameters(ROBsize,Loadqueue size,maximumI-cache fills,anddecodewidth)ontwo programs. The top plots display the timeseries of the throughput bounds derived by our analytical model for each parameter (details in 3.2.1) across 400-instruction windows, and the ground truth Instructions per Cycle (IPC) for the same windows. For both programs, the through- put bound timeseries explain the IPC trends well. For example, for program A, initially the IPC (green line) aligns with the maximum I-cache fills bound (cyan segments); subsequently, the IPC is around the smaller of the ROB, decode width, and maximum I-cache fills 1For simplicity, this section focuses on CPU parameters. Concorde handles a few parameters such as cache sizes differently ( 3). Program (𝐱) Architecture Specific. (𝐩) CPI ML Model 𝘨(𝐳, 𝐩) Performance Features Analytical Models 𝘈1(𝐱, p1) d𝑧 𝘈d(𝐱, 𝚙d) 1𝑧 Figure 2: Concorde s compositional analytical-ML structure bounds in most instruction windows. Similarly, for program B, the bounds for ROB and Load queue overlap with the IPC. The maximum I-cache fills and decode width throughput bounds are much higher for program B (not shown in the figure). Although the minimum of the per resource throughput bounds provides an estimate of IPC, it is not accurate. As shown in Figure 1, despite their overall correlation, the IPC frequently deviates from the exact minimum bound. This is not surprising. The analytical models make simplifying approximations, including ignoring interactions between multiple resource bottlenecks. In reality, resource bottle- necks can overlap, resulting in a net IPC lower than any individual bound. Nonetheless, the per-resource analysis provides informative features for predicting performance, capturing key first-order effects while leaving it to the ML model to capture higher-order effects. The last step of deriving compact performance features (inde- pendent of program length 𝐿) is converting throughput timeseries into distributions, as depicted in the bottom plots in Figure 1. We encode these distributions using a fixed set of percentiles from their Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF). Converting timeseries to CDFs is inherently lossy (e.g., joint behaviors across timeseries are not retained). However, as Figure 1 shows, the CDFs are still informative for predicting IPC. In particular, the IPC (vertical dashed line) aligns well with the lower percentiles of the smaller throughput bounds (e.g., Maximum I-cache fills and ROB for program A) an im- plication of the IPC s proximity to the minimum throughput bound in most instruction windows. As our experimental results will show, a simple ML model can learn to accurately map these CDFs to IPC. Concorde s compositional analytical-ML structure. Figure 2 illustrates the two-stage structure of Concorde. To predict the per- formance of program x on a given microarchitecture p, Concorde first uses per-component analytical models to derive performance features z (𝑧 1, ... ,𝑧 𝑑), where 𝑧 𝑖represents the distribution of the throughput bound for parameter 𝑝𝑖. These features, along with the list of parameters, are then passed to a lightweight ML model ˆ𝑦 𝑔( z, p) to predict the CPI. An important consequence of modeling each component (param- eter) separately in the analytical stage is the ability to precompute the performance features for a program ( x) across the entire mi- croarchitectural design space. In particular, our approach eliminates the need to evaluate the Cartesian product of all parameters, which wouldrequireexponentialtimeandspace.Instead,Concordesweeps the range of each CPU parameter (once or per memory configura- tion depending on the parameter), precomputing the feature set {𝐴𝑖( x,𝑝𝑖) 𝑝𝑖, 𝑖}. To predict the performance of x on a specific mi- croarchitecture p,Concorderetrievesthepertinentprecomputedfea- tures corresponding to 𝑝1,...,𝑝𝑑and evaluates the ML model 𝑔( z, p). 3 A.

Offline ①Trace Analysis DynamoRIO Trace Concorde Trace ②Analytical Models Performance Distributions ③Selection ③ML Model CPI Architecture Specification Figure 3: Design overview 3 Concorde Design We present a concrete realization of Concorde designed to approx- imate a proprietary gem5-based cycle-level trace-driven simulator. Inevitably, some aspects of Concorde (esp., analytical models) de- pend on the specifics of the reference architecture. We detail the design for our in-house cycle-level simulator while emphasizing concepts that we believe apply broadly to CPU modeling. Our cycle-level simulator processes program traces captured by DynamoRIO [17] and features a generic parameterized Out-of-Order (OoO) core model similar to gem5 s O3 CPU model [57]. The archi- tecture consists of fetch, decode, and rename stages in the frontend; issue, execute, and commit stages in the backend; and uses Ruby [58] for modeling the memory system.2 We focus on modeling the im- pact of 20 key design parameters on CPI, as summarized in Table 1, though our approach can be extended to other design parameters. Figure 3 outlines Concorde s key design elements: 1 Trace anal- ysis which augments the input DynamoRIO [17] trace with informa- tion needed for Concorde ( 3.1); 2 Per-resource analytical mod- els which transform the processed trace into performance distribu- tions ( 3.2); and 3 Lightweight ML model which predicts the CPI based on performance distributions ( 3.3). The first two stages per- form a one-time, offline computation for a given DynamoRIO trace. At simulation time, Concorde supplies the precomputed perfor- mance distributions and target microarchitecture s design parame- ters to the ML model, enabling nearly instantaneous CPI predictions. 3.1 Trace Analysis The raw input trace to Concorde is captured using DynamoRIO s drmemtrace client [16], which provides detailed instruction and data access information for the target program. This trace is then processed into a Concorde Trace, which includes per-instruction information needed for our analytical models. We categorize this information into microarchitecture independent and microarchitec- ture dependent features, as detailed below. Microarchitecture independent. This category includes data de- riveddirectlyfromtheDynamoRIOtrace:(i)Instructiondependencies, includingbothregisterandmemorydependencies,(ii)Programcoun- ters(PC)forallinstructions,(iii)DatacachelinesforLoadinstructions, 2We use a fixed LLC size of 4MB, and a cache replacement policy similar to gem5 s TreePLURP, a pseudo-Least Recently Used (PLRU) replacement policy. Our cache allocation policy is the same as gem5 s standard allocation policy, always allocating lines on reads and writebacks. A cache line is not allocated on sequential access (for L2 and LLC) or a unique read for LLC. We use writeback for all L1i, L1d, L2, and LLC. We use memory BW of 37GB s with latency of 90ns, and do not model memory channels.

Microarchitecture dependent. (i) Execution latency: Our analyt- ical models require an estimate of the execution latency for each instruction. For non-memory instructions, we estimate the latency based on the opcode and corresponding execution unit (e.g., 3 cy- cles for integer ALU operations). Store instructions also incur a fixed, known latency, as the architecture uses write-back (with store forwarding). Load instructions, however, have variable latency de- pending on the cache level. To estimate their latency, we perform a simple in-order cache simulation (per memory configuration) to determine the cache level for each Load. We then map each cache leveltoaconstantlatency(e.g.,L1 4cycles,L2 10cycles,LLC 30 cycles, RAM 200 cycles). (ii) I-cache latency: To model the fetch stage, our analytical models need an estimate of I-cache access times, which we obtain by performing a simple in-order I-cache simulation (per memory configuration). (iii) Branch misprediction rate, which we obtain by simulating the target branch prediction algorithm on the DynamoRIO trace. Our implementation supports two branch predictors: Simple, a branch predictor that mispredicts randomly with a pre-specified misprediction rate, and TAGE [8, 77]. Improving memory modeling. The execution times assigned to Load instructions by the above procedure can be highly inaccurate in some cases, leading Concorde s analytical models astray. As we will see, Concorde s ML model can overcome many errors in the analytical model. However, in extreme cases at the tail, Concorde s accuracy is affected by discrepancies between the results of trace analysis and the program s actual behavior ( 5.2.1). The key challenge with analyzing Load instructions is that their executiontimescanchangedependingonthetimeandorderinwhich they are issued. Of course, a simple in-order cache simulation cannot capture timing-dependent effects. However, we now discuss a refine- mentatopthebasiccachesimulationthataddressestwolargesources oferrorsinestimatingLoadexecutiontimes.Ourapproachisbuilton two principles for accounting for the effects of conflicting cache lines and instruction order without running detailed timing simulations.

Now suppose these Loads are issued at around the same time in the actual OoO core, e.g., first Load at cycle 0 and second Load at cycle 1. Naïvely using the cache simulation results, we might conclude that the first Load com- pletes at cycle 200 and the second Load at cycle 5. But, in reality, both Loads will complete after 200 cycles because the second Load must wait for the first Load to fetch the data from main memory into L1 cache. This example motivates our first principle: the response cycle for consecutive Loads accessing the same cache line is non-decreasing. Next, consider the same scenario, but with the two Loads issued in reverse order in the OoO core (e.g., due to a register dependency). With this reversed order, the second Load (issued first) becomes a main memory access, and the first Load (issued second) becomes an L1 hit. Thus, our second principle: the access levels of Loads with the same cache line is determined by their issue order, not the instruction order (used in cache simulation). We incorporate these principles into atrace-drivenstatemachineformemory(Algorithm1).Thefunction RespCycle returns the response cycle (execution completion cycle) for an instruction issued at cycle 𝑟𝑒𝑞_𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒. For non-Load instruc- tions,itsimplyusestheexecutiontimeestimatedbythestandardpro- cedure described earlier. For Loads, however, it adjusts the execution time to account for their cache line and issue times. We use this mem- ory model in the analytical models of ROB and Load queue, which are sensitive to Load execution latencies ( 3.2). The memory model is fast and does not materially increase the cost of analytical modeling. 3.2 Analytical Models As discussed in 2, Concorde s primary features are a set of through- put distributions associated with each potential microarchitectural resource bottleneck. We describe the derivation of these distribu- tions for various resources in 3.2.1. We then discuss a few auxiliary features in 3.2.2 that capture nuances not covered by the primary features, further improving the ML model s accuracy. Thebulkof Concorde sdesignefforthasgoneintoanalyticalmod- eling. Before delving into details, we highlight a few lessons from our experience. Our guiding principle has been to capture the perfor- mance trends imposed by a microarchitectural bottleneck, without beingoverlyconcernedwithprecision.Asourresultswillshow( 5.2), the ML model serves as a powerful backstop that can mask signif- cant errors in the analytical model. Thus, we have generally avoided undue complexity (admittedly a subjective metric!) to improve the analytical model s accuracy. Our decision to simply analyze each resource in isolation ( 2) is the clearest example of this philosophy. Isolated per-resource throughput analysis is similar to traditional roofline analysis [18], but we perform it at an unusually fine gran- ularity to analyze the impact of low-level resources (e.g., an issue queue, fetch buffers, etc.) on small windows (e.g., few 100s) of in- structions. The details of such analyses depend on the design, but we have found three types of models to be useful: (i) closed-form mathematical expressions, (ii) dynamical system equations, (iii) sim- ple discrete-event simulations of a single component. We provide examples of these methods below. 3.2.1 Per-Resource Throughput Analysis. We calculate the through- put of each CPU resource over fixed windows of 𝑘consecutive in- structions, assuming no other CPU component is bottlenecked. The parameter 𝑘should be small enough to observe phase changes in the program s behavior, but not so small that throughput fluctuates wildly due to bursty instruction processing (e.g., a few instructions). We have found that any value of 𝑘in the order of the ROB size, typically a few hundred instructions, works well. Given a program region (e.g., 100K-1M instructions), Concorde divides it into consecutive 𝑘-instruction windows and calculates the throughput bound for each window, per CPU resource and pa- rameter value (Table 1). Concorde converts all throughput bound timeseries into distributions (CDFs) to arrive at the set of perfor- mance distributions for the entire microarchitectural design space. Memory parameters (L1i d, L2, L1d prefetcher degree) do not have separate throughput features; they affect the instruction ex- ecution latency and I-cache latency estimates ( 3.1) used in CPU resource analyses. Specifically, the throughput computations for ROB, and Load Store queues rely on instruction execution laten- cies. Concorde performs throughput calculations for these resources per L1d L2 prefetch configuration using the corresponding execu- tion latency values in the Concorde trace. Similarly, the I-cache fills throughput calculations are performed per L1i L2 cache size. ROB.TheROBisthemostcomplexcomponenttomodel,encapsulat- ing out-of-order execution constrained by instruction dependencies and in-order commit behavior. For an instruction𝑖, we define Dep(𝑖) as its immediate (register and memory) dependencies obtained via trace analysis ( 3.1), 𝑎𝑖as its arrival cycle to the ROB, 𝑠𝑖as its execu- tion start cycle, 𝑓𝑖as its execution finish cycle, and 𝑐𝑖as its commit cycle. We calculate the throughput induced by a ROB of size ROB using the following instruction-level dynamical system: 𝑎𝑖 𝑐𝑖 ROB, (1) 𝑠𝑖 max 𝑎𝑖,max 𝑓𝑑 𝑑 Dep(𝑖) , (2) 𝑓𝑖 RespCycle 𝑠𝑖,instr𝑖 , (3) 𝑐𝑖 max(𝑓𝑖,𝑐𝑖 1), (4) 5 A. Nasr-Esfahany et al. for 𝑖 1, where 𝑐𝑖 0 for 𝑖 0 by convention. Equation (1) enforces the size constraint of the ROB. Equation (2) accounts for the instruc- tion dependency constraints. Equation (3) uses the function shown in Algorithm 1 ( 3.1) to determine the finish time of each instruc- tion.3 Equation (4) models the in-order commit constraint. Finally, the throughput for the 𝑗th window of 𝑘instructions is calculated as: thr𝑗 ROB 𝑘 𝑐𝑘𝑗 𝑐𝑘(𝑗 1) . (5) Load Store queue. The Load and Store queues bound the number of issued memory instructions that have yet to be committed (in order). We briefly discuss the Load queue model (Store queue is analogous). It is identical to the ROB model, with two differences: (i) the calcu- lations are performed exclusively for Load instructions, (ii) there are no dependency constraints: a Load is eligible to start as soon as it obtains a slot in the queue. After computing the commit cycle for each Load, we derive the throughput for each 𝑘-instruction window similarly to Equation (5). In these calculations, non-Load operations are assumed to be free and incur no additional latency. Static bandwidth resources. These resources impose limits on the number of instructions (of a certain type) that can be serviced in a single clock cycle. For example, Commit, Fetch, Decode, and Rename widths constrain the throughput of all instructions. The through- put bound imposed by these resources is trivially their respective width. In contrast, issue queues restrict the throughput for a specific group of instructions, e.g., ALU, Floating-point, and Load-Store issue widths in our reference architecture. To compute the throughput bound imposed by such resources, we compute the processing time of the instructions that are constrained by that resource and assume non-affected instructions incur no additional latency. For instance, the throughput bound induced by the ALU issue width in the 𝑗-th window of 𝑘consecutive instructions is given by: thr𝑗 ALU 𝑘 𝑛𝑗 ALU ALU issue width, (6) where 𝑛𝑗 ALU is the number of ALU instructions in window 𝑗. Dynamic constraints. Some resources impose constraints on a dynamic set of instructions determined at runtime based on the mi- croarchitectural state. Analyzing such resources is more challenging. Two strategies that we have found to be helpful are to use simplified performance bounds or basic discrete-event simulation. We briefly discuss these strategies using two examples. Load Load-Store Pipes. Finite Load and Load-Store pipes limit the number of memory instructions that can be issued per cycle. Store in- structions exclusively use Load-Store pipes, while Load instructions can utilize both Load pipes and Load-Store pipes. The allocation of instructions to these pipes depends on dynamic microarchitectural state, e.g., the precise order that memory instructions become eligi- ble for issue and the exact pipes available at the time of each issue. Rather than model such complex dynamics, we derive simple upper and lower bounds on the throughput. Let 𝑛𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑and 𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒denote the number of Load and Store instructions in a𝑘-instruction window, 𝐿𝑆𝑃the number of Load-Store pipes, and 𝐿𝑃the number of Load 3We execute Equation (3) in order of instruction start times 𝑠𝑖to satisfy Algorithm 1 s requirement for non-decreasing request cycles. pipes. The worst-case allocation of pipes is to issue Loads first using all available pipes, and only then begin issuing Stores using the Load- Store pipes. This allocation leaves the Load pipes idle while Stores are being issued. It results in the maximum total processing time: 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 (𝐿𝑆𝑃 𝐿𝑃) 𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝐿𝑆𝑃, and thus a lower-bound on the throughput of the pipes component: 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑘 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥. The best-case allocation is to grant Stores exclusive access to Load-Store pipes while concurrently using Load pipes to issue Loads. Once all Stores are issued, the Load Store pipes are allocated to the remaining Loads. Analogous to the lower bound, we can derive an upper bound on the throughput 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟based on this allocation (details omitted for brevity). We summarize these bounds using the distribution of 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟and 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟over all instruction windows. I-cache fills and fetch buffers. We model these resources using sim- ple instruction-level simulations. Here, we focus on I-cache fills for brevity. The maximum I-cache fills restricts the number of in-flight I-cache requests at any given time. This is a dynamic constraint, because whether an instruction generates a new I-cache request de- pendsonthesetofin-flightI-cacherequestswhenitreachesthefetch targetqueue.Specifically,newrequestsareissuedonlyforcachelines that are not already in-flight. We estimate the throughput constraint imposed by the maximum I-cache fills using a basic simulation of I-cache requests. This simulation assumes a backlog of instructions waiting to be fetched, restricted only by the availability of I-cache fill slots. Instructions are considered in order, and if they need to send an I-cache request, they send it as soon as an I-cache fill slot becomes available. We record the I-cache response cycle for each instruction in the simulation, and use it to calculate the throughput for each window of 𝑘consecutive instructions similarly to Equation (5). 3.2.2 Auxiliary Features. In addition to the primary features de- scribed above, we describe a few auxiliary features that capture nuances not covered by per-resource throughput analysis. We eval- uate the impact of these auxiliary features in 5.2.2. Pipeline stalls. Unlike resource constraints, modeling the effects of pipeline stalls caused by branch mispredictions and ISB instruc- tions as an isolated component is not meaningful. The impact of stalls on performance depends on factors beyond the fetch stage, for instance, the inherent instruction-level parallelism (ILP) of the program, how long it takes to drain the pipeline, and how quickly the stall is resolved [30]. Rather than try to model these complex dynamics analytically, we incorporate two simple groups of fea- tures to assist the ML model with predicting the impact of pipeline stalls. First, we provide basic information about the extent of stalls: (i) the distribution of the number of ISBs in our windows of 𝑘con- secutive instructions; (ii) the distribution of the count of the three branch types ( 3.1) per instruction window, (iii) the overall branch misprediction rate obtained from trace analysis. Additionally, we provide the overall throughput calculated by our analytical ROB model ( 3.2.1) for varying ROB sizes, ROB {1,2,4,8,...,1024}. The intuition behind this feature is that pipeline stalls effectively reduce theaverageoccupancyoftheROB,loweringthebackendthroughput of the CPU pipeline. Therefore, the ROB model s estimate of how throughput varies versus ROB size can provide valuable context for how sensitive a program s performance is to pipeline stalls. 6 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion Table 2: Workload space with 5486B instructions from 29 programs Type Name Traces Instructions (M) Proprietary Compression (P1) 4 1845 Search1 (P2) 168 17854 Search4 (P3) 170 23188 Disk (P4) 168 23441 Video (P5) 268 26981 NoSQL Database1 (P6) 168 30283 Search2 (P7) 84 52989 MapReduce1 (P8) 84 56677 Search3 (P9) 1334 69277 Logs (P10) 191 75845 NoSQL Database2 (P11) 84 91274 MapReduce2 (P12) 84 104750 Query Engine Database (P13) 790 1195128 Cloud Benchmark Memcached (C1) 8 2791 MySQL (C2) 84 9283 Open Benchmark Dhrystone (O1) 1 174 CoreMark (O2) 1 335 MMU (O3) 132 18475 CPUtest (O4) 138 95215 SPEC2017 505.mcf_r (S1) 19 197232 520.omnetpp_r (S2) 20 214749 523.xalancbmk_r (S3) 20 214749 541.leela_r (S4) 20 214749 548.exchange2_r (S5) 20 214749 531.deepsjeng_r (S6) 20 214749 557.xz_r (S7) 38 408022 500.perlbench_r (S8) 41 440235 525.x264_r (S9) 44 472447 502.gcc_r (S10) 94 999282 Latency distributions. We augment our primary throughput based features from 3.2 with three instruction-level latency distributions collected from the ROB model. Specifically, we provide the distribu- tionofthetimethatinstructionsspendintheissue(𝑠𝑖 𝑎𝑖),execution (𝑓𝑖 𝑠𝑖), and commit (𝑐𝑖 𝑓𝑖) stages of the ROB model (Equations (1) to (4)) for ROB {1,2,4,8,...,1024}.4 These latency distributions pro- vide additional context that can be useful for understanding certain nuances of the performance dynamics. For example, the execution la- tency distribution indicates whether a program is load-heavy, which can be useful for predicting memory congestion. 3.3 ML Model Thefinalcomponentof Concorde sdesignisalightweightMLmodel that predicts the CPI of a program on a specified architecture. The model is a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (details in 4) that takes as input a concatenation of (i) the performance distributions corresponding to the target microarchitecture ( 3.2.1), (ii) the auxil- iary features ( 3.2.2), and (iii) a 20-dimensional vector of parameters ( p) representing the target microarchitecture (Table 1). We train the ML model on a dataset constructed by randomly sampling diverse program regions and microarchitectures. We simulate each sample program region and sample microarchitecture using the cycle-level simulator to collect the ground-truth target CPI. To train the ML model, we use a loss function that measures the relative magnitude of CPI prediction error, as follows: 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠( ˆ𝑦,𝑦) ˆ𝑦 𝑦 𝑦 , (7) where ˆ𝑦denotes the predicted CPI and𝑦denotes the CPI label. 4 Concorde s Implementation Details Trace analyzer and analytical models. We implement the trace analyzer and analytical models in C . Trace analysis performs in-order cache simulation (per memory configuration) and branch 4The execution latency does not depend on ROB size; therefore, we only include one copy of the execution latency distribution feature.

To precompute the performance features for a program, we run the trace analyzer for each mem- ory configuration to derive the Concorde trace, and then run the analytical models for all parameter values of each CPU resource independently. Our current implementation uses a single thread, but all analytical model invocations could run in parallel. To calculate performance distributions, Concorde uses a window size of 𝑘 400. Dataset. Unless specified otherwise, Concorde uses a dataset with 789,024 data points for training, with an additional 48,472 unseen (test) data points reserved for evaluation. Every data point is con- structed by independently sampling a microarchitecture, and a 100k- instruction region. To sample a microarchitecture, we independently pick a random value from Table 1 for every parameter. Concorde s large microarchitecture space ( 2 1023) ensures that test microar- chitectures are almost surely unseen during training, preventing memorization. To sample a program region, we sample a program from Table 2, sample a trace of the chosen program randomly with probability proportional to trace length, and sample a region ran- domly from this trace. Figure 4 shows the average overlap of test pro- gram regions with their closest training region (the training region with maximum instruction overlap) for every program. The overlap is 16.86 on average, and less than 10 for the majority of programs. Table 3: ML model s 3873-dimensional input.

Concorde s ML component uses a fully connected MLP with a 3873-dimensional input layer and two hidden layers with sizes 256 and 128 that outputs a scalar CPI prediction. For encoding every input distribution to the ML model, Concorde uses a 101-dimensional encoding which includes 50 fixed equally-spaced percentiles of the original distribution, 50 fixed equally-spaced per- centiles of the size-weighted distribution,5 and the average value. Table 3 shows the breakdown of the input dimensions to the fea- tures detailed in 3. Note that in the first column, we do not include throughput distributions for static bandwidth resources that remain constant throughout the entire program such as Commit width. In the last column, we use one-hot vectors for the branch predictor type and the state of prefetching. We use the AdamW [56] optimizer with weight decay of 0.3, learning rate of 0.001 that halves after {10,14,18,22}k steps, and batch size of 50k to train for 1521 epochs. 5The size weighted distribution is a transformation of the original distribution of a non-negative random variable in which we weight every sample by its value. This transform highlights the tail of the original distribution. 7 A.

In 5.2, we dive deeper into its accuracy and our design choices. 5.1 Concorde s Accuracy and Speed Accuracy on random microarchitectures. To highlight the gen- eralization capability of Concorde across microarchitectures, we first evaluate its accuracy on the unseen test split of the dataset ( 4), where microarchitectures are randomly sampled. Figure 5 illus- trates Concorde s relative CPI prediction error (Equation (7)) vs. the ground-truthCPIfromourgem5-basedcycle-levelsimulator.Thetop and left plots besides the axes show the distributions of the CPI and Concorde s prediction error across all samples.

Recall from 4thatsuchaccuracycannotbeachievedbymemorizationsince the microarchitectures in our test dataset are not seen in the training samples.Figure6showstheerrorbreakdownacrossprograms.While some programs are more challenging than others, the average error and P90 is capped at 4.2 and 8.9 , respectively. Furthermore, the errors do not correlate well with the per program train test overlaps in Figure 4. For instance, Concorde s average error is less than 1 for S4 and S6, and only slightly over 1 for P12, all of which have train test overlaps less than 3.5 . This highlights Concorde s effec- tiveness in generalizing (in distribution) across program regions. 0 2 4 6 8 10 Relative CPI Error ( ) 0 50 100 CDF ( ) 100k instructions 1M instructions Figure 7: Concorde is more accurate on longer program regions.

Recall that one of the main design goals of Concorde is to avoid a run time cost that scales with the number of instructions (O(𝐿)). Hence, unlike cycle-level simulators that operate on sequence of instructions, Concorde takes as input a fixed- size performance characterization of the program independent of the program length. To evaluate Concorde on longer program re- gions, we create a new dataset similar to the original one ( 4) with longer program regions of 1M instructions and re-train Concorde on it. Figure 7 shows the distribution of Concorde s relative CPI prediction error over the unseen test split of this dataset (solid green line). The average error is 1.75 and only 1.82 of cases have larger than 10 error, which is slightly better than Concorde s accuracy on the original 100k-instruction region dataset (dashed blue line). We hypothesize that this is because the average CPI has less variability over longer regions due to the phase behaviors getting averaged out (which we confirmed by comparing the CPI variance in the two cases). This reduced variance makes the learning task easier for longer regions, boosting Concorde s accuracy. Accuracy on ARM N1. To assess Concorde s accuracy on a realis- tic microarchitecture, we evaluate its CPI predictions for ARM N1 (Table 1), using the 100k-instruction regions in the test split of our dataset ( 4). It has an average error of 3.25 with 4.39 of program regions having errors larger than 10 , which is a slight degrada- tion in the accuracy compared to random microarchitectures. We believe that this is because randomly sampled microarchitectures are more likely to have a single dominant bottleneck while ARM N1 is designed to be balanced. Comparison with TAO [71]. We compare Concorde with TAO, the previous SOTA in sequence-based approximate performance modeling. Unlike Concorde, TAO does not generalize without addi- tional retraining beyond a single microarchitecture. Hence, we train it for ARM N1 on a dataset of 100M randomly sampled instructions from SPEC2017 programs (Table 2). Figure 8 compares TAO s CPI prediction accuracy on 100𝑘-instruction regions from SPEC2017 programs with Concorde s; Concorde is more accurate for every single program. This is despite the fact that Concorde is trained on random microarchitectures whereas TAO is specialized to ARM N1. Accuracy on long programs. Using Concorde s CPI predictions for finite program regions as the building block, we can estimate the 8 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion P12 P9 P2 P11 O4 P7 S5 O2 S7 S6 1 3 5 7 9 11 CPI error ( ) 10 samples 30 samples 100 samples 300 samples Figure 9: Accuracy for long programs vs. number of samples 10 3 10 1 101 103 105 Running time (s) 20 50 80 CDF ( ) Concorde Concorde (100 samples) cycle-level (1B instrs) cycle-level (1M instrs) Figure 10: Concorde is five seven orders of magnitude faster than a cycle-level simulator on 1M 1B-instruction program regions. CPI for arbitrarily long programs by randomly sampling program re- gions and averaging their predicted CPIs. As an example, we use the 1M-instruction region model to predict the CPI for programs with 1B instructions. Figure 9 shows Concorde s accuracy in predicting CPI for ARM N1, across ten such 1B-instruction programs, with four sampling levels. As shown, with as little as 100 samples, Concorde s error gets below 5 for every program, with an average error of 3.5 . Using 300 samples, the average error decreases to 3.16 . Concorde s Speed. Figure 10 shows the running time distribution of Concordeandourgem5-basedcycle-levelsimulator.Wemeasurethe running time of Concorde and the cycle-level simulator on a single CPU core. For these experiments, we simulate from the first instruc- tion of each trace, to avoid extra warmup overheads for the cycle- level simulator. The average running time of Concorde (solid blue) is 168𝜇sec. Compared to our cycle-level simulator, Concorde achieves an average speedup of more than 2 105 for 1M-instruction regions. Furthermore, Concorde s running time does not change with the length of the instruction region (e.g., 100k 1M) since the size of its input distributions are fixed. In contrast, the cycle-level simulator s running time scales with the program region length, e.g., 487 by increasing the length from 1M (green) to 1B (red) instructions. Recall that to estimate the CPI of 1B-instruction programs in Figure 9, we used Concorde s predictions on randomly sampled 1M-instruction regions. The dashed dotted line in Figure 10 shows the running time distribution for processing 100 samples, measured on the same CPU. Even with 100 sequential samples, Concorde s average running time (1.7𝑚sec) is about 107 times faster than the cycle-level simulator for programs with 1B instructions. Additionally, the running time of the cycle-level simulator exhibits a high variance due to its dependence on the number of cycle-level events, which varies with programs and microarchitectures. In contrast, Concorde s running time has mini- malvariancesinceitscomputationisdeterministicirrespectiveofthe program or the microarchitecture. Note that the reported speedups donotincludethebenefitsofbatchingConcorde scalculationsonac- celerators such as GPUs, which would further amplify its advantage. 0.9 1.1 1.5 2 Execution Time Ratio 10 30 50 70 90 CDF ( ) 5 10 15 20 Relative CPI Error ( ) ratio [0.9, 1.1) ratio [1.1, 1.5) ratio [1.5, ) Figure 11: Although the ML component of Concorde corrects for a large portion of errors in estimates of instruction execution times from trace analysis, this error plays a significant role in the tail of Concorde s error distribution. 5.2 Deep Dive 5.2.1 What constitutes Concorde s error tail? Recall from 5.1 that Concorde has a small error tail, where tail is defined as cases with larger than 10 error. Here, we detail our attempts to understand some of the factors responsible for the tail. Discrepancy in raw execution times. Recall that Concorde s ana- lytical models use approximate instruction execution times derived in trace analysis ( 3.1). As we discussed in 3.1, these estimated executions times can differ from the actual values observed during timing simulations. Figure 11 (left) shows the distribution of the ratio of the actual instruction execution times in timing simulations to their estimates from trace analysis, across 100k-instruction regions in our test dataset ( 4). More than 10 of program regions have a ratio larger than 1.5. These discrepancies can occur for a variety of reasons, including memory congestion, partial store forwarding, etc. that we do not account for in trace analysis. With high errors in their raw inputs, our analytical models will be inaccurate. We bucketize program regions based on the above ratio into three buckets, and plot Concorde s prediction error distribution for samples in each bucket (Figure 11, right). The result shows that Concorde s prediction error increases for the buckets with larger execution time discrepancy. But its accuracy remains quite high, even with significant discrepancies, e.g., achieving an average error of 4.53 in cases with ratio larger than 1.5. This shows that the ML component of Concorde can correct for significant errors in the ana- lytical models. Nonetheless, errors in execution time estimates from trace analysis account for a large portion of the tail of Concorde s er- ror distribution. Among test program regions that have errors larger than 10 , 41.5 have execution time ratios larger than 1.5 (whereas only about 10 of all program regions have a ratio larger than 1.5). Branch prediction. Recall from 3.2 that unlike other CPU compo- nents, Concorde does not analytically model branch mispredictions. Instead, it relies on a set of auxiliary features that are helpful for learning the effect of pipeline stalls. We will show in 5.2.2 that these features indeed boost Concorde s overall accuracy. Here, we study whether branch mispredictions are another source of Concorde s errortail.Table4categorizesConcorde saccuracybasedonthenum- ber of branch mispredictions in 100k-instruction regions of the test dataset ( 4). Intriguingly, Concorde s accuracy improves as the num- ber of mispredictions increases, with an average error of 1.82 in regions with over 5,000 branch mispredictions. We hypothesize that this is because programs with large number of stalls have low paral- lelism and simpler dynamics, making them easier to predict. This re- sult confirms that Concorde s branch-related features are sufficient. 9 A. Nasr-Esfahany et al. Table 4: Concorde successfully learns the effect of branch prediction.

Recall from 3.2.2 that Concorde uses a few auxiliary features to augment the primary per-component through- put distributions. We train several variants of Concorde to under- stand the impact of these features. For reference, we begin with a simple minimum over the per-component throughput bounds (no ML). As shown by the pink line in Figure 12, this has poor accu- racy, achieving an average error of 65 (and 11 in cases with no branch misprediction). Concorde s base ML model, which takes as input the per-component throughput distributions along with the branch misprediction rate, significantly boosts accuracy (red line), achieving an average error of 3.32 with errors exceeding 10 in only 4.48 of cases. Further adding the auxiliary features ( 3.2.2) related to pipeline stalls (green) and instruction latency distributions (blue) provides incremental accuracy improvements, reducing av- erage error to 2.4 and 2.03 and the percentage of samples with errors larger than 10 to 3.7 and 2.51 , respectively. In addition, we ablated the ML model size, and the choice of 𝑘, the length of instruction windows for throughput calculations ( 3.2). Expanding the model to three hidden layers of sizes 512, 256, and 128 slightly lowers the average error on random microarchitectures from 2.03 to 1.85 , while reducing it to a single hidden layer of size 256 increases the error to 3.91 . Varying 𝑘 {100,200,400} did not have a significant effect on our results. 5.2.3 Preprocessing cost. Precomputing the performance features for a 1M-instruction region for all the 2.2 1023 parameter combina- tions in Table 1 takes 3959 seconds on a single CPU core equivalent to the time required for 107 cycle-level simulations with similar warmup. This includes 195s for trace analysis ( 3.1) and 3764s for analytical modeling ( 3.2). Trace analysis comprises one TAGE, 40 D-cache, and 20 I-cache simulations. The dominant factors in ana- lytical modeling are 40 1024 ROB model invocations (3327s) and 40 256 invocations of the Load Store queue models (211s 211s). The precomputed performance features occupy 24MB in uncompressed NumPy [38] format. Table 1 sweeps all parameters in increments of 1, but such a fine granularity is typically not necessary in practice. Quantizing the pa- rameter space can significantly reduce the precomputation time. For example, considering powers of 2 for ROB, Load and Store queues, i.e, ROB {1,2,4,...,1024}, Load Store queue {1,2,4,...,256}, reduces 200 300 400 500 600 700 Training Dataset Size (k) 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 CPI Error ( ) Smaller dataset Full dataset Figure 13: Impact of training dataset size on Concorde s accuracy P12 P11 P1 P13 P4 P5 P10 P8 P6 P3 P7 P2 P9 C2 C1 O1 O3 O2 O4 S4 S6 S5 S8 S9 S2 S7 S3 S1 S10 5 10 15 CPI Error ( ) 26 4203 40 32 128 512 2048 8192 Number of seen new program samples 5 10 15 20 25 CPI Error ( ) S1 C2 O4 O3 Figure 14: Errors can be high on unseen programs (top). However, Concorde recovers quickly as it trains on their samples (bottom). the analytical modeling time to 63s , lowering the total preprocessing time for the resulting 1.8 1018 parameter combinations to 257s (7 cycle-level simulations). Techniques like QEMU [12] could further reduce trace analysis time [25]. 5.2.4 Training cost. ML training takes 3 hours on a TPU-v3-8 [1] cloud server with 8 TensorCores (2.7 hours on an AMD EYPC Milan processor with 64 cores). To generate the training dataset ( 4), we only run trace analysis and analytical modeling for one (randomly selected) microarchitecture for each program region. Using 512 cores, it takes 19.4 hours to create the more expensive 1M-instructionregiondatasetwith837,496datapoints.Thisincludes 16.8 hours for cycle-level simulations (to generate the CPI labels), 2.2 hours for trace analysis, and 26 minutes for analytical modeling. Although training is a one-time cost, it can be reduced at a slight degradation in model accuracy. Figure 13 shows that reducing the training dataset size to 200k samples gradually increases the relative CPI error from 2.01 to 3.07 . Further reduction to 100k samples increases the error to 4.67 . 5.2.5 Out-of-Distribution(OOD)Generalization. LikeanyMLmodel, we expect Concorde to be trained on a diverse dataset of programs representative of programs of interest. However, to stress test pro- gram generalization, for every program, we train Concorde on a dataset that excludes all its traces and evaluate the accuracy of the resulting model on that program. Figure 14 (top) shows the average OOD error for all programs. As expected, the error increases, with some programs being affected more than others. 23 programs (blue) have OOD error below 10 . The 3 programs with the highest error (red) are synthetic microbenchmarks testing specific microarchitec- tural capabilities. These programs are unlike any other in the dataset. For instance, O3 (a memory test), has much higher CPIs compared 10 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion to other programs in Table 2. The 3 remaining programs (orange), with OOD error of about 15 , are real workloads that stand out from the others. For example, as we will see in 6, S1 has the highest sensitivity to cache sizes among all workloads in Table 2. Compared to generalization across microarchitectures, OOD gen- eralization across programs is not a major concern. Programs and benchmarks used for CPU architecture exploration are relatively sta- ble. For example, SPEC CPU benchmarks are only updated every few years, and we similarly see infrequent updates to our internal suite of benchmarks. Nevertheless, we quantify the cost of onboarding new programs into Concorde for O3, O4 (2 highest red bars), and S1, C2 (2 highest orange bars). For each of these programs, we train Concorde on all other programs together with a varying number of samples from the new program. As Figure 14 (bottom) shows, 2k (8k) samples from the new program are enough for Concorde to reach within 5 (2 ) of the error floor achieved by the model trained on the full dataset with 30𝑘samples per program (Figure 6). O3 and O4 have the steepest drop in error, which is likely due to the regularity of these synthetic benchmarks. 5.2.6 Can Concorde predict metrics other than CPI? Although we focused on CPI in designing our analytical models, Concorde s rich performance distributions are useful for predicting other metrics as well. To illustrate this point, we retrain Concorde s ML model (without changing hyperparameters) to predict the average Rename queue occupancy ( ) and average ROB occupancy ( ), on the same datasetusedforCPI( 4).Onunseentestsamples,Concordeachieves an average prediction error of 2.50 and 2.23 , respectively, vs. the ground-truth metrics from our gem5-based simulator. 6 Fine-Grained Performance Attribution Beyond predicting performance, architects often need to understand why a program performs as it does on a certain design. In this section, we present a methodology for fine-grained attribution of perfor- mance to different microarchitectural components. Our method can be used in conjunction with any performance model𝑦 𝑓( x, p) relat- ingmicroarchitecturalparameterstoperformance.Butaswewillsee, it is computationally impractical for expensive models such as cycle- level simulators. Concorde s massive speedup over conventional methods makes such large-scale, fine-grained analyses possible. Concretely, our goal is to quantify the relative impact of different microarchitectural parameters p on the performance of a program x. This requires identifying the dominant performance bottlenecks. Manyexistingperformanceanalysistechniques(e.g.,Top-Down[92], CPI stacks [29]) rely on hardware performance counters to identify bottlenecks. We seek to obtain similar insights using only a perfor- mance model𝑦 𝑓( x, p) like Concorde that outputs the (predicted) performance of a program given the microarchitectural parameters. Performance of a single microarchitecture p provides no information about which of the parameters𝑝𝑖are important. Thus, we use param- eter ablations, where we change some parameters and observe their impact on performance. Intuitively, parameters that have a large ef- fect on performance when modified are more important. Parameter ablations are commonly used to understand the impact of design choices [23, 37, 67, 91]. A typical approach is to start with microarchi- tectural parameters p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒representing a baseline design, and modify one parameter (dimension) at a time to reach a target design with Cache LQ LQ Cache Shapley 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 CPI 53 458 501 277 234 Baseline Small caches Small LQ Figure 15: Changing the order of parameter ablations (Cache Load Queue vs. Load Queue Cache) leads to different conclusions about their relative importance. Shapley values provide a fair, order-independent performance attribution to design parameters. parameters p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡. After each parameter change, the incremental change in performance is reported as the contribution of that param- eter to the total performance difference between p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒and p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡. Although this methodology is standard, it can be difficult to draw sound conclusions from parameter ablations when there are multi- ple inter-related factors effecting performance. The issue is that the order of parameter ablations can change the perceived importance of different factors. To illustrate, suppose we are interested in quan- tifying the relative impact of (i) limited cache size and (ii) limited Load queue size on a memory-intensive workload. As a baseline, we consider a big core with all parameters set to their largest value in Table 1, particularly: L1d L1i cache 256kB, L2d cache 4MB, and Load queue 256. Figure 15 shows the CPI achieved by this baseline (Grey bars) on a sample trace from the Search3 workload. Next, we consider two parameter ablations atop the baseline, where we reduce the cache sizes and the Load queue size to our tar- get values: L1d L1i cache 64kB, L2d cache 1MB, Load queue 12. In one ablation, we first reduce the cache sizes and then the Load queue size; in the other ablation, we reduce the Load queue size first, then reduce cache size. The two left bars in Figure 15 show the CPI trajectory for both routes, along with the CPI increase associated with reducing cache sizes and Load queue size in each case. The overlaid numbers show the percentage CPI increase relative to the baseline following each parameter change. The two orders of parameter ablations lead to entirely different conclusions.The(Cache Loadqueue)ordersuggeststhatreducing the Load queue size has about 9 larger impact than reducing the cachesizes. The(Load queue Cache)order,on theotherhand, says that reducing the Load queue has negligible effect and the perfor- mance degradation is almost entirely caused by reducing the cache sizes. Neither of these interpretations is correct. The reality is that the effects of cache and Load queue size are intertwined. A large Load queue can mitigate the performance hit of small caches for this workload (due to increased parallelism). Similarly, a large cache size can perform well despite a small Load queue (since Load instructions complete quickly). It is only when both the Load queue and cache sizes are small that we incur a large performance hit. Shapley value: a fair, order-independent attribution. A natural way to remove the bias caused by a specific order of parameter ab- lations is to consider the average of all possible orders. Let Π denote the set of all permutations of the parameter indices 𝐷 {1,...,𝑑}. Each permutation 𝜋 Π corresponds to one order of ablating the parameters from p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒to p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡, resulting in a different value for the incremental effect of modifying parameter 𝑖. 11 A. Nasr-Esfahany et al. Specifically, define p𝜋(𝑗) (p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝜋1:𝑗 ,p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝜋𝑗 1:𝑑) to be the 𝑗𝑡ℎmicroar- chitecture encountered in the ablation study based on order 𝜋, i.e., parameters 𝜋1,...,𝜋𝑗are set to their target values and the rest re- main at the baseline. Let 𝑘denote the position of parameter 𝑖in the order 𝜋. Then, the incremental effect of parameter 𝑖in order 𝜋is: Δ𝜋 𝑖 𝑓(x,p𝜋(k)) 𝑓(x,p𝜋(k-1)). To assign an overall attribution to parameter 𝑖, we take the average over all permutations: 𝜑𝑖 1 Π 𝜋 Π Δ𝜋 𝑖, (8) where Π 𝑑! is the total number of permutations. The quantity defined in Equation (8) is referred to as the Shapley value [78] in economics. The concept arises in cooperative game theory, where a group of 𝑀players work together to generate value 𝑣(𝑀). Shapley s seminal work showed that the Shapley value is a fair distribution of 𝑣(𝑀) among the players, in that it is the only way to divide 𝑣(𝑀) that satisfies certain desirable properties (refer to [78] for details). In our context, the players are the different microarchitectural components, and the value to be divided is the performance difference between the baseline and target microarchi- tectures.6 The Shapley value is used in many areas of science and engineering [5, 13, 33, 60, 64 66], but to our knowledge, we are the first to apply it to performance attribution in computer architecture. The rightmost bar in Figure 15 shows the Shapley values cor- responding to cache and Load queue sizes in the above example. The Shapley value correctly captures that small caches and small Load queue sizes are together the culprit for high CPI relative to the baseline, with a slightly larger attribution to small caches. Case study. To illustrate Shapley value analysis, we use it for fine- grained performance attribution in a target design based on the ARM N1 core [73] (parameters in Table 1) across our entire pool of pro- grams. As baseline, we use the big core configuration mentioned above (perfect branch prediction, other parameters set to their max). ComputingShapleyvaluesiscomputationallyexpensive.Foreach program (region), using Eq. (8) directly requires𝑑! 𝑑performance evaluations, where 𝑑is the number of parameters. We can calculate an accurate Monte Carlo estimate of Eq. (8) using a few hundred ran- domly sampled permutations, but even that requires a massive num- ber of performance evaluations for large-scale analyses. For example, estimatingShapleyvaluesforourcorpusofworkloads(Table2)using 2000 sample regions per program and 200 permutations of parameter orders requires 143M CPI evaluations in total. This is impractical with existing cycle-level simulators; we estimate it would take about a month on a 1024-core server! With Concorde, the computation takesaboutanhouronaTPU-v3[1]cloudserverwith8TensorCores. Figure 16 shows the result of our analysis. The grey bars show the reference CPI achieved by the big core baseline, while the entire bars show the CPI achieved by ARM N1. Within each work- load group, i.e., proprietary, cloud, open-source, and SPEC2017, the programs are sorted based on the relative CPI increase of ARM N1 compared to the baseline. For instance, in SPEC2017 benchmarks, S1(505.mcf_r) has the largest relative jump in CPI for ARM N1, whereas S7(557.xz_r) has the smallest relative CPI increase. The colored bars in Figure 16 show the Shapley value for each microarchitectural component, i.e., how much each component in 6It is not difficult to see that: Í 𝑖𝜑𝑖 𝑓(x,p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡) 𝑓(x,p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒).

This provides a bird s eye view of the dominant per- formance bottlenecks across the entire corpus of workloads. For instance, all the proprietary programs and half of the SPEC2017 programs are mainly backend bound on ARM N1, with prominent bottlenecks being the Load queue size and ROB size. A few programs such as S4(541.leela_r) (a chess engine using tree search) are frontendbound,withtheTAGEbranchpredictorthemostprominent frontend bottleneck. Cache sizes and L1 prefetching have a large effect on some SPEC2017 benchmarks (e.g., S10(502.gcc_r), S1) but a less pronounced impact on our proprietary workloads, perhaps in indication of our programs being cache-optimized.

Conventional simulators [3, 4, 6, 11, 15, 19, 22, 28, 32, 34, 42, 63, 69, 72, 74, 75, 84, 94, 95] aim to balance speed and accuracy, leveraging higher abstraction levels [19, 32], or decoupled simulations of core and shared resources [28, 75]. While these methods achieve faster simulations, they often compromise flexibility or accuracy. Hardware-accelerated simulators [22, 47] im- prove speed but require extensive development effort for validation. Statistical modeling tools [27, 36, 46, 79 81, 90] reduce computation bysamplingrepresentativesegments[80,90]orgeneratingsynthetic traces [26, 68], but they trade off flexibility and detailed insights. Analytical performance models. Analytical models [2, 21, 41, 48, 49, 86, 87] provide quick performance estimates using parameterized equations and microarchitecture-independent profiling. Such meth- ods are ideal for crude design space exploration but often lack the granularity needed to capture intricate 𝜇-architectural dynamics. 12 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion ML- and DL-based performance models. Conventional ML based models [24, 43 45, 51 53, 76, 89, 96] predict performance over con- strained design spaces but often struggle with fine-grained program- hardware interactions. In contrast, Concorde demonstrates robust generalization across unseen programs and microarchitectures. Re- cent DL-based models [20, 54, 61, 70, 71, 83, 93] improve modeling at a higher abstraction levels at the cost of higher compute. Notably, PerfVec[54] (significant training overhead) and TAO[71] (additional finetuning for unseen configurations) emphasize per-instruction embeddings. Our work diverges by compactly capturing program- level performance characteristics using analytical models and fusing themwithalightweightMLmodelforcapturingdynamicbehaviors. 8 Final Remarks The key lesson from Concorde is that decomposing performance models into simple analytical representations of individual microar- chitectural components, fused together by an ML model capturing higher-order complexities, is very effective. It enables a method that is both extremely fast and accurate. Before concluding, we remark on some limitations of our work and directions for future research. Concorde does not obviate the need for detailed simulation. It en- ables large-scale design-space explorations not possible with current methods (e.g., Shapley value analysis ( 6)), but some analyses will inevitably require more detailed models. Moreover, Concorde needs training data to learn the impact of design changes (e.g., different parameters), which we currently obtain using a reference cycle-level simulator. In principle, Concorde could be trained on data from any reference platform, including emulators and real hardware. As an ML approach, Concorde s accuracy is inherently statistical. Our results show high accuracy for a vast majority of predictions, but there is a small tail of cases with high errors. We have analyzed some of the causes of these errors ( 5.2.1), and we believe that further improvements to the analytical models (e.g., explicitly modeling in- memorycongestion)canfurtherreducethetail.Butwedonotexpect that tail cases can be eliminated entirely. Alternatively, a large set of techniques exist for quantifying the uncertainty of such ML mod- els [9, 10, 31]. Future work on providing confidence bounds would allow designers to detect predictions with high potential errors and crosscheck them with other tools. Finally, Concorde was just one example of our compositional analytical-ML modeling approach. We believe that the methodology is broadly applicable and we hope that future work will extend it to other use cases, such as modeling multi-threaded systems, uncore components, and other architectures (e.g., accelerators).

We present Concorde, a new methodology for learningfastandaccurateperformancemodelsofmicroarchitectures. Unlike existing simulators and learning approaches that emulate each instruction, Concorde predicts the behavior of a program based on compact performance distributions that capture the impact of dif- ferent microarchitectural components. It derives these performance distributions using simple analytical models that estimate bounds on performance induced by each microarchitectural component, pro- viding a simple yet rich representation of a program s performance characteristics across a large space of microarchitectural parameters. Experiments show that Concorde is more than five orders of mag- nitude faster than a reference cycle-level simulator, with about 2 average Cycles-Per-Instruction (CPI) prediction error across a range of SPEC, open-source, and proprietary benchmarks. This enables rapid design-space exploration and performance sensitivity analyses that are currently infeasible, e.g., in about an hour, we conducted a first-of-its-kind fine-grained performance attribution to different microarchitectural components across a diverse set of programs, requiring nearly 150 million CPI evaluations. 1 Introduction Microarchitecture simulators are a key tool in the computer archi- tect sarsenal[4,6,11,14,19,28,72,75,82].FromSimpleScalar[11]to gem5 [14, 59], simulators have enabled architects to explore new de- signs and optimize existing ones without the prohibitive costs of fab- rication.\n\n--- Segment 2 ---\nThis enables rapid design-space exploration and performance sensitivity analyses that are currently infeasible, e.g., in about an hour, we conducted a first-of-its-kind fine-grained performance attribution to different microarchitectural components across a diverse set of programs, requiring nearly 150 million CPI evaluations. 1 Introduction Microarchitecture simulators are a key tool in the computer archi- tect sarsenal[4,6,11,14,19,28,72,75,82].FromSimpleScalar[11]to gem5 [14, 59], simulators have enabled architects to explore new de- signs and optimize existing ones without the prohibitive costs of fab- rication. CPU simulation, in particular, has become increasingly im- portant as hyperscale companies like Google (Axion) [85], Amazon (Graviton) [7], Microsoft (Cobalt) [62] increasingly invest in devel- oping custom CPU architectures tailored to their specific workloads. The landscape of CPU performance modeling is characterized by a critical tension between model accuracy and speed. This trade-off manifests in the various levels of abstraction employed by different performance models [14, 32, 87]. At one end of the spectrum lie analytical models [2, 87], which provide simplified mathematical representations of microarchitectural components and their inter- actions. Although they are fast, analytical models often lack the detailed modeling necessary to capture the dynamics of modern pro- cessorsaccurately.Attheotherendofthespectrumresidecycle-level simulators like gem5 [14], which can provide high-fidelity results by meticulously modeling every cycle of execution. However, this level Work done at Google. of detail comesat a steep computational cost, becoming prohibitively slow for large-scale design space exploration [32, 47, 55], programs with billions of instructions, or detailed sensitivity studies. Recognizing the limitations of conventional methods, there has been growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to expedite CPU simulation [54, 55, 61, 71]. Rather than explicitly model ev- ery cycle and microarchitectural interaction, these methods learn an approximate model of the architecture s performance from a large corpus of data. A typical approach is to pose the problem as learning a function mapping a sequence of instructions to the tar- get performance metrics.\n\n--- Segment 3 ---\nRather than explicitly model ev- ery cycle and microarchitectural interaction, these methods learn an approximate model of the architecture s performance from a large corpus of data. A typical approach is to pose the problem as learning a function mapping a sequence of instructions to the tar- get performance metrics. For example, recent work [50, 54, 55, 71] train sequence models (e.g., LSTMs [35] and Transformers [88]) on ground-truth data from a cycle-level simulator to predict metrics such as the program s Cycles Per Instruction (CPI). These methods show promise in providing fast performance esti- mates with reasonable accuracy. However, relying on black-box ML models operating on instruction sequences has several limitations. First, the computational cost of these methods scales proportionally with the length of the instruction sequence, i.e. O(𝐿) where 𝐿is the instruction sequence length. The O(𝐿) complexity limits the potential speedup of these methods, e.g., to less than 10 faster than cycle-level simulation with a single GPU [55, 71]. This speedup is mainlyduetoreplacingtheirregularcomputationsofcycle-levelsim- ulation with accelerator-friendly neural network calculations [71]. By contrast, analytical models can be several orders of magnitude faster than cycle-level simulation (and current ML approaches) be- cause they fundamentally operate at a higher level of abstraction, i.e., mathematical expressions relating key statistics (e.g., instruction mix, cache behavior, branch misprediction rate, etc.) to performance. Second, existing ML approaches must learn all the dynamics im- pacting performance from raw instruction-level training data. In many cases, this learning task is unnecessarily complex since it does not exploit the CPU performance modeling problem structure. For example, TAO s Transformer model [71] must learn the perfor- mance impact of register dependencies from per-instruction register information, even though there exist higher-level abstractions (e.g., instruction dependency graphs [61]) that concisely represent depen- dency behavior ( 3.2).\n\n--- Segment 4 ---\nIn many cases, this learning task is unnecessarily complex since it does not exploit the CPU performance modeling problem structure.

By ignoring the problem structure, blackbox methodsrequireasignificantamountoftrainingdatatolearn.Forex- ample, TAO trains on a dataset of 180 million instructions across four benchmarks and two microarchitectures [71], with further training required for each new microarchitecture. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to per- formance modeling compositional analytical-ML fusion where we decompose the task into multiple lightweight models that work 1 arXiv:2503.23076v1 [cs.AR] 29 Mar 2025 A.

Concorde achieves constant-time O(1) inference complexity, in- dependent of the length of the instruction stream, while maintaining high accuracy across diverse workloads and microarchitectures. Un- like existing ML methods that operate on instruction sequences, Concorde predicts performance based on a compact set of perfor- mance distributions. It trains a lightweight ML model a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map these performance distribu- tions to the target performance metric. We focus on modeling CPI in thispaperasitdirectlyreflectsprogramperformance,thoughinprin- ciple our techniques could be extended to other metrics.

Concorde s ML model generalizes across a large space of designs, specified via a set of parameters associated with different microarchitectural com- ponents ( 3). Given the performance distributions for a program region (e.g., 1M instructions), predicting its CPI on any target mi- croarchitecture is extremely fast; it requires only a single neural network evaluation, taking less than a millisecond. Concorde derives a program region s performance distributions through a two-step process: trace analysis and analytical modeling. Trace analysis uses simple in-order cache and branch predictor sim- ulators to extract information such as instruction dependencies, ap- proximate execution latencies, and branch misprediction rate. Next, analytical models estimate the bottleneck throughput imposed by each CPU component (e.g., fetch buffer, load queue, etc.) in isolation, assuming other CPU components have infinite capacity. For each CPU component, Concorde uses the distribution of its throughput bound over windows of a few hundred instructions as its perfor- mance feature. For each memory configuration, Concorde executes the per-component analytical models independently to precompute the set of performance distributions for all parameter values. The analytical models are lightweight, completing in 10s of milliseconds for a million instructions. Precomputing the performance distribu- tions is a one-time cost, enabling nearly instantaneous performance predictions across the entire parameter space. Concorde s unique division of labor between analytical and ML modeling simplifies both the analytical and ML models. Since the an- alytical models are not directly used to predict performance, they are relatively easy to construct. Their main goal is to provide a first-cut estimate of the performance bounds associated with each microar- chitectural component (akin to roofline analysis [18]), without the burden of quantifying the combined effect of multiple interacting components. The ML model, on the other hand, starts with features that correlate strongly with a program s performance, rather than raw instruction sequences. Its task is to capture the higher-order effects ignored by the analytical models, such as the impact of multi- ple interacting bottlenecks. The net result is a method that is as fast as analytical models while achieving high accuracy.\n\n--- Segment 6 ---\nIts task is to capture the higher-order effects ignored by the analytical models, such as the impact of multi- ple interacting bottlenecks. The net result is a method that is as fast as analytical models while achieving high accuracy. Concorde enables large-scale analyses that are deemed imprac- tical with conventional methods. As one use case, we consider the problem of fine-grained performance attribution to different mi- croarchitectural components: What is the relative contribution of different microarchitectural components to the predicted performance of a target architecture? We present a novel technique for answering thisquestionusingonlyaperformancemodelrelatingmicroarchitec- tural parameters to performance. Our technique applies the concept of Shapley value [78] from cooperative game theory to provide a fair and rigorous attribution of performance to individual components. The method improves upon standard parameter ablation studies and may be of interest in other use cases beyond Concorde. We present a concrete realization of Concorde, designed to ap- proximate the behavior of a proprietary gem-5 based cycle-level trace-driven CPU simulator. We train Concorde on a dataset of 1 mil- lionrandomprogramregionsandarchitectures,topredicttheimpact of 20 parameters spanning frontend, backend, and memory (total- ing 2.2 1023 parameter combinations). The program regions are sampled from a diverse set of SPEC2017 [40], open-source, and pro- prietary benchmarks. The key findings of our evaluation are: Concorde saverageCPIpredictionerroriswithin2 oftheground- truth cycle-level simulator for unseen (random) program regions and architectures, with only 2.5 of samples exceeding a 10 pre- diction error. Ignoring the one-time cost of analytical modeling, Concorde is five orders of magnitude faster for predicting the performance of 1M-instruction regions. For long 1B instruction programs, Concorde accurately estimates performance (average error 3.2 ) based on randomly-sampled program regions, seven- orders of magnitude faster than cycle-level simulation. InpredictingCPIforarealisticcoremodel(basedonARMN1[73]), Concorde is more accurate than TAO [71], the state-of-the-art sequence-based ML performance model, trained specifically for the same core configuration.

It achieves an average prediction error of 3.5 , compared to 7.8 for TAO. For a 1M-instruction region, precomputing all the performance distributions takes the CPU time equivalent of 7 to 107 cycle-level simulations, depending on the granularity of parameter sweeps. Theseperformancefeaturesenablerapidperformancepredictions for 1.8 1018 to 2.2 1023 parameter combinations. Concorde enables a first of its kind, large-scale, fine-grained per- formance attribution to components of a core based on ARM N1, across a diverse set of programs using our Shapley value tech- nique. This large-scale analyses requires more than 143M CPI evaluations, but takes only about one hour with Concorde. 2 Motivation and Insights Consider a cycle-level simulator like gem5 as implementing a func- tion that maps an input program and microarchitecture configura- tion to a performance metric such as CPI. Formally,𝑦 𝑓( x, p), where x (𝑥1,...,𝑥𝐿) denotes the input program comprising 𝐿instructions, p (𝑝1,...,𝑝𝑑) the parameters specifying the microarchitecture, and 𝑦the CPI achieved by program x on microarchitecture p. Our goal is to learn a fast and accurate approximation of the function 𝑓from training examples derived from cycle-level simulations. Supervised learning provides the de facto framework for learning a function from input-output examples. However, a critical design decision involves how to best represent the learning problem, in- cluding the selection of representative features and an appropriate model architecture.\n\n--- Segment 8 ---\nSupervised learning provides the de facto framework for learning a function from input-output examples. However, a critical design decision involves how to best represent the learning problem, in- cluding the selection of representative features and an appropriate model architecture. Several recent efforts [54, 55, 71] represent the function 𝑓using sequence-based models, such as LSTMs [35] and 2 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion Instruction ID 1 2 3 IPC A (Timeseries) Instruction ID B (Timeseries) ROB Load queue Maximum icache fills Decode width Ground truth IPC 1 2 3 IPC 0 100 CDF ( ) A (Distributions) 1 2 3 IPC B (Distributions) Figure 1: Per-resource analytical modeling produces a rich perfor- mance characterization of a program. Transformers [88], operating on raw or minimally processed in- struction sequences. As discussed in 1, these blackbox sequence models inherently limit scalability and increase the complexity of the learning task. Our key insight is a novel decomposition of the function 𝑓, comprising of two key stages. First, an analytical stage uses simple per-component models to extract compact performance features capturing the overall performance characteristics of the program. Second, a lightweight ML model predicts the target CPI metric efficiently based on these performance features. Deriving compact performance features. The foundation of our analytical stage is to characterize the bottleneck throughput im- posed by each CPU resource1 individually, under the simplifying assumption that all other CPU components operate with unlimited capacity. For instance, to analyze the impact of the reorder buffer (ROB) size, we evaluate the program s throughput in a hypothetical system constrained only by the ROB size and instruction dependen- cies (i.e., a perfect frontend with no backend resource bottlenecks other than the limited ROB size). Focusing on one resource at a time enables relatively straightforward analyses (see 3.2 for examples). Formally, given a program x, we compute the bottleneck throughput 𝑧𝑖 𝐴𝑖( x,𝑝𝑖) for each CPU component, where 𝐴𝑖( , ) is the analyt- ical model for the 𝑖th component, parameterized by 𝑝𝑖.\n\n--- Segment 9 ---\nFocusing on one resource at a time enables relatively straightforward analyses (see 3.2 for examples). Formally, given a program x, we compute the bottleneck throughput 𝑧𝑖 𝐴𝑖( x,𝑝𝑖) for each CPU component, where 𝐴𝑖( , ) is the analyt- ical model for the 𝑖th component, parameterized by 𝑝𝑖.

Figure 1 shows an illustrative example of these throughput calcu- lationsforfourmicroarchitecturalparameters(ROBsize,Loadqueue size,maximumI-cache fills,anddecodewidth)ontwo programs. The top plots display the timeseries of the throughput bounds derived by our analytical model for each parameter (details in 3.2.1) across 400-instruction windows, and the ground truth Instructions per Cycle (IPC) for the same windows. For both programs, the through- put bound timeseries explain the IPC trends well. For example, for program A, initially the IPC (green line) aligns with the maximum I-cache fills bound (cyan segments); subsequently, the IPC is around the smaller of the ROB, decode width, and maximum I-cache fills 1For simplicity, this section focuses on CPU parameters. Concorde handles a few parameters such as cache sizes differently ( 3). Program (𝐱) Architecture Specific.

Similarly, for program B, the bounds for ROB and Load queue overlap with the IPC. The maximum I-cache fills and decode width throughput bounds are much higher for program B (not shown in the figure). Although the minimum of the per resource throughput bounds provides an estimate of IPC, it is not accurate.\n\n--- Segment 10 ---\nThe maximum I-cache fills and decode width throughput bounds are much higher for program B (not shown in the figure). Although the minimum of the per resource throughput bounds provides an estimate of IPC, it is not accurate. As shown in Figure 1, despite their overall correlation, the IPC frequently deviates from the exact minimum bound. This is not surprising. The analytical models make simplifying approximations, including ignoring interactions between multiple resource bottlenecks. In reality, resource bottle- necks can overlap, resulting in a net IPC lower than any individual bound. Nonetheless, the per-resource analysis provides informative features for predicting performance, capturing key first-order effects while leaving it to the ML model to capture higher-order effects. The last step of deriving compact performance features (inde- pendent of program length 𝐿) is converting throughput timeseries into distributions, as depicted in the bottom plots in Figure 1. We encode these distributions using a fixed set of percentiles from their Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF). Converting timeseries to CDFs is inherently lossy (e.g., joint behaviors across timeseries are not retained). However, as Figure 1 shows, the CDFs are still informative for predicting IPC. In particular, the IPC (vertical dashed line) aligns well with the lower percentiles of the smaller throughput bounds (e.g., Maximum I-cache fills and ROB for program A) an im- plication of the IPC s proximity to the minimum throughput bound in most instruction windows. As our experimental results will show, a simple ML model can learn to accurately map these CDFs to IPC. Concorde s compositional analytical-ML structure. Figure 2 illustrates the two-stage structure of Concorde. To predict the per- formance of program x on a given microarchitecture p, Concorde first uses per-component analytical models to derive performance features z (𝑧 1, ... ,𝑧 𝑑), where 𝑧 𝑖represents the distribution of the throughput bound for parameter 𝑝𝑖. These features, along with the list of parameters, are then passed to a lightweight ML model ˆ𝑦 𝑔( z, p) to predict the CPI.\n\n--- Segment 11 ---\nTo predict the per- formance of program x on a given microarchitecture p, Concorde first uses per-component analytical models to derive performance features z (𝑧 1, ... ,𝑧 𝑑), where 𝑧 𝑖represents the distribution of the throughput bound for parameter 𝑝𝑖.

An important consequence of modeling each component (param- eter) separately in the analytical stage is the ability to precompute the performance features for a program ( x) across the entire mi- croarchitectural design space.

The archi- tecture consists of fetch, decode, and rename stages in the frontend; issue, execute, and commit stages in the backend; and uses Ruby [58] for modeling the memory system.2 We focus on modeling the im- pact of 20 key design parameters on CPI, as summarized in Table 1, though our approach can be extended to other design parameters. Figure 3 outlines Concorde s key design elements: 1 Trace anal- ysis which augments the input DynamoRIO [17] trace with informa- tion needed for Concorde ( 3.1); 2 Per-resource analytical mod- els which transform the processed trace into performance distribu- tions ( 3.2); and 3 Lightweight ML model which predicts the CPI based on performance distributions ( 3.3). The first two stages per- form a one-time, offline computation for a given DynamoRIO trace. At simulation time, Concorde supplies the precomputed perfor- mance distributions and target microarchitecture s design parame- ters to the ML model, enabling nearly instantaneous CPI predictions. 3.1 Trace Analysis The raw input trace to Concorde is captured using DynamoRIO s drmemtrace client [16], which provides detailed instruction and data access information for the target program. This trace is then processed into a Concorde Trace, which includes per-instruction information needed for our analytical models. We categorize this information into microarchitecture independent and microarchitec- ture dependent features, as detailed below. Microarchitecture independent.

Load instructions, however, have variable latency de- pending on the cache level. To estimate their latency, we perform a simple in-order cache simulation (per memory configuration) to determine the cache level for each Load. We then map each cache leveltoaconstantlatency(e.g.,L1 4cycles,L2 10cycles,LLC 30 cycles, RAM 200 cycles).

Our implementation supports two branch predictors: Simple, a branch predictor that mispredicts randomly with a pre-specified misprediction rate, and TAGE [8, 77]. Improving memory modeling. The execution times assigned to Load instructions by the above procedure can be highly inaccurate in some cases, leading Concorde s analytical models astray. As we will see, Concorde s ML model can overcome many errors in the analytical model.

Naïvely using the cache simulation results, we might conclude that the first Load com- pletes at cycle 200 and the second Load at cycle 5. But, in reality, both Loads will complete after 200 cycles because the second Load must wait for the first Load to fetch the data from main memory into L1 cache. This example motivates our first principle: the response cycle for consecutive Loads accessing the same cache line is non-decreasing. Next, consider the same scenario, but with the two Loads issued in reverse order in the OoO core (e.g., due to a register dependency). With this reversed order, the second Load (issued first) becomes a main memory access, and the first Load (issued second) becomes an L1 hit. Thus, our second principle: the access levels of Loads with the same cache line is determined by their issue order, not the instruction order (used in cache simulation). We incorporate these principles into atrace-drivenstatemachineformemory(Algorithm1).Thefunction RespCycle returns the response cycle (execution completion cycle) for an instruction issued at cycle 𝑟𝑒𝑞_𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒. For non-Load instruc- tions,itsimplyusestheexecutiontimeestimatedbythestandardpro- cedure described earlier. For Loads, however, it adjusts the execution time to account for their cache line and issue times. We use this mem- ory model in the analytical models of ROB and Load queue, which are sensitive to Load execution latencies ( 3.2). The memory model is fast and does not materially increase the cost of analytical modeling. 3.2 Analytical Models As discussed in 2, Concorde s primary features are a set of through- put distributions associated with each potential microarchitectural resource bottleneck. We describe the derivation of these distribu- tions for various resources in 3.2.1. We then discuss a few auxiliary features in 3.2.2 that capture nuances not covered by the primary features, further improving the ML model s accuracy.\n\n--- Segment 20 ---\nWe describe the derivation of these distribu- tions for various resources in 3.2.1. We then discuss a few auxiliary features in 3.2.2 that capture nuances not covered by the primary features, further improving the ML model s accuracy. Thebulkof Concorde sdesignefforthasgoneintoanalyticalmod- eling. Before delving into details, we highlight a few lessons from our experience. Our guiding principle has been to capture the perfor- mance trends imposed by a microarchitectural bottleneck, without beingoverlyconcernedwithprecision.Asourresultswillshow( 5.2), the ML model serves as a powerful backstop that can mask signif- cant errors in the analytical model. Thus, we have generally avoided undue complexity (admittedly a subjective metric!) to improve the analytical model s accuracy. Our decision to simply analyze each resource in isolation ( 2) is the clearest example of this philosophy. Isolated per-resource throughput analysis is similar to traditional roofline analysis [18], but we perform it at an unusually fine gran- ularity to analyze the impact of low-level resources (e.g., an issue queue, fetch buffers, etc.) on small windows (e.g., few 100s) of in- structions. The details of such analyses depend on the design, but we have found three types of models to be useful: (i) closed-form mathematical expressions, (ii) dynamical system equations, (iii) sim- ple discrete-event simulations of a single component. We provide examples of these methods below. 3.2.1 Per-Resource Throughput Analysis. We calculate the through- put of each CPU resource over fixed windows of 𝑘consecutive in- structions, assuming no other CPU component is bottlenecked. The parameter 𝑘should be small enough to observe phase changes in the program s behavior, but not so small that throughput fluctuates wildly due to bursty instruction processing (e.g., a few instructions). We have found that any value of 𝑘in the order of the ROB size, typically a few hundred instructions, works well. Given a program region (e.g., 100K-1M instructions), Concorde divides it into consecutive 𝑘-instruction windows and calculates the throughput bound for each window, per CPU resource and pa- rameter value (Table 1).\n\n--- Segment 21 ---\nWe have found that any value of 𝑘in the order of the ROB size, typically a few hundred instructions, works well. Given a program region (e.g., 100K-1M instructions), Concorde divides it into consecutive 𝑘-instruction windows and calculates the throughput bound for each window, per CPU resource and pa- rameter value (Table 1). Concorde converts all throughput bound timeseries into distributions (CDFs) to arrive at the set of perfor- mance distributions for the entire microarchitectural design space. Memory parameters (L1i d, L2, L1d prefetcher degree) do not have separate throughput features; they affect the instruction ex- ecution latency and I-cache latency estimates ( 3.1) used in CPU resource analyses. Specifically, the throughput computations for ROB, and Load Store queues rely on instruction execution laten- cies. Concorde performs throughput calculations for these resources per L1d L2 prefetch configuration using the corresponding execu- tion latency values in the Concorde trace. Similarly, the I-cache fills throughput calculations are performed per L1i L2 cache size.

For an instruction𝑖, we define Dep(𝑖) as its immediate (register and memory) dependencies obtained via trace analysis ( 3.1), 𝑎𝑖as its arrival cycle to the ROB, 𝑠𝑖as its execu- tion start cycle, 𝑓𝑖as its execution finish cycle, and 𝑐𝑖as its commit cycle.\n\n--- Segment 22 ---\nROB.TheROBisthemostcomplexcomponenttomodel,encapsulat- ing out-of-order execution constrained by instruction dependencies and in-order commit behavior. For an instruction𝑖, we define Dep(𝑖) as its immediate (register and memory) dependencies obtained via trace analysis ( 3.1), 𝑎𝑖as its arrival cycle to the ROB, 𝑠𝑖as its execu- tion start cycle, 𝑓𝑖as its execution finish cycle, and 𝑐𝑖as its commit cycle. We calculate the throughput induced by a ROB of size ROB using the following instruction-level dynamical system: 𝑎𝑖 𝑐𝑖 ROB, (1) 𝑠𝑖 max 𝑎𝑖,max 𝑓𝑑 𝑑 Dep(𝑖) , (2) 𝑓𝑖 RespCycle 𝑠𝑖,instr𝑖 , (3) 𝑐𝑖 max(𝑓𝑖,𝑐𝑖 1), (4) 5 A. Nasr-Esfahany et al. for 𝑖 1, where 𝑐𝑖 0 for 𝑖 0 by convention. Equation (1) enforces the size constraint of the ROB. Equation (2) accounts for the instruc- tion dependency constraints. Equation (3) uses the function shown in Algorithm 1 ( 3.1) to determine the finish time of each instruc- tion.3 Equation (4) models the in-order commit constraint. Finally, the throughput for the 𝑗th window of 𝑘instructions is calculated as: thr𝑗 ROB 𝑘 𝑐𝑘𝑗 𝑐𝑘(𝑗 1) . (5) Load Store queue. The Load and Store queues bound the number of issued memory instructions that have yet to be committed (in order). We briefly discuss the Load queue model (Store queue is analogous).\n\n--- Segment 23 ---\nThe Load and Store queues bound the number of issued memory instructions that have yet to be committed (in order). We briefly discuss the Load queue model (Store queue is analogous). It is identical to the ROB model, with two differences: (i) the calcu- lations are performed exclusively for Load instructions, (ii) there are no dependency constraints: a Load is eligible to start as soon as it obtains a slot in the queue. After computing the commit cycle for each Load, we derive the throughput for each 𝑘-instruction window similarly to Equation (5). In these calculations, non-Load operations are assumed to be free and incur no additional latency. Static bandwidth resources. These resources impose limits on the number of instructions (of a certain type) that can be serviced in a single clock cycle. For example, Commit, Fetch, Decode, and Rename widths constrain the throughput of all instructions. The through- put bound imposed by these resources is trivially their respective width. In contrast, issue queues restrict the throughput for a specific group of instructions, e.g., ALU, Floating-point, and Load-Store issue widths in our reference architecture. To compute the throughput bound imposed by such resources, we compute the processing time of the instructions that are constrained by that resource and assume non-affected instructions incur no additional latency. For instance, the throughput bound induced by the ALU issue width in the 𝑗-th window of 𝑘consecutive instructions is given by: thr𝑗 ALU 𝑘 𝑛𝑗 ALU ALU issue width, (6) where 𝑛𝑗 ALU is the number of ALU instructions in window 𝑗. Dynamic constraints. Some resources impose constraints on a dynamic set of instructions determined at runtime based on the mi- croarchitectural state. Analyzing such resources is more challenging. Two strategies that we have found to be helpful are to use simplified performance bounds or basic discrete-event simulation. We briefly discuss these strategies using two examples. Load Load-Store Pipes. Finite Load and Load-Store pipes limit the number of memory instructions that can be issued per cycle. Store in- structions exclusively use Load-Store pipes, while Load instructions can utilize both Load pipes and Load-Store pipes.\n\n--- Segment 24 ---\nFinite Load and Load-Store pipes limit the number of memory instructions that can be issued per cycle. Store in- structions exclusively use Load-Store pipes, while Load instructions can utilize both Load pipes and Load-Store pipes. The allocation of instructions to these pipes depends on dynamic microarchitectural state, e.g., the precise order that memory instructions become eligi- ble for issue and the exact pipes available at the time of each issue. Rather than model such complex dynamics, we derive simple upper and lower bounds on the throughput. Let 𝑛𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑and 𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒denote the number of Load and Store instructions in a𝑘-instruction window, 𝐿𝑆𝑃the number of Load-Store pipes, and 𝐿𝑃the number of Load 3We execute Equation (3) in order of instruction start times 𝑠𝑖to satisfy Algorithm 1 s requirement for non-decreasing request cycles. pipes. The worst-case allocation of pipes is to issue Loads first using all available pipes, and only then begin issuing Stores using the Load- Store pipes. This allocation leaves the Load pipes idle while Stores are being issued. It results in the maximum total processing time: 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 (𝐿𝑆𝑃 𝐿𝑃) 𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝐿𝑆𝑃, and thus a lower-bound on the throughput of the pipes component: 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑘 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥. The best-case allocation is to grant Stores exclusive access to Load-Store pipes while concurrently using Load pipes to issue Loads. Once all Stores are issued, the Load Store pipes are allocated to the remaining Loads.\n\n--- Segment 25 ---\nThe best-case allocation is to grant Stores exclusive access to Load-Store pipes while concurrently using Load pipes to issue Loads. Once all Stores are issued, the Load Store pipes are allocated to the remaining Loads. Analogous to the lower bound, we can derive an upper bound on the throughput 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟based on this allocation (details omitted for brevity). We summarize these bounds using the distribution of 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟and 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟over all instruction windows. I-cache fills and fetch buffers. We model these resources using sim- ple instruction-level simulations. Here, we focus on I-cache fills for brevity. The maximum I-cache fills restricts the number of in-flight I-cache requests at any given time. This is a dynamic constraint, because whether an instruction generates a new I-cache request de- pendsonthesetofin-flightI-cacherequestswhenitreachesthefetch targetqueue.Specifically,newrequestsareissuedonlyforcachelines that are not already in-flight. We estimate the throughput constraint imposed by the maximum I-cache fills using a basic simulation of I-cache requests. This simulation assumes a backlog of instructions waiting to be fetched, restricted only by the availability of I-cache fill slots. Instructions are considered in order, and if they need to send an I-cache request, they send it as soon as an I-cache fill slot becomes available. We record the I-cache response cycle for each instruction in the simulation, and use it to calculate the throughput for each window of 𝑘consecutive instructions similarly to Equation (5). 3.2.2 Auxiliary Features. In addition to the primary features de- scribed above, we describe a few auxiliary features that capture nuances not covered by per-resource throughput analysis. We eval- uate the impact of these auxiliary features in 5.2.2. Pipeline stalls. Unlike resource constraints, modeling the effects of pipeline stalls caused by branch mispredictions and ISB instruc- tions as an isolated component is not meaningful.\n\n--- Segment 26 ---\nPipeline stalls. Unlike resource constraints, modeling the effects of pipeline stalls caused by branch mispredictions and ISB instruc- tions as an isolated component is not meaningful. The impact of stalls on performance depends on factors beyond the fetch stage, for instance, the inherent instruction-level parallelism (ILP) of the program, how long it takes to drain the pipeline, and how quickly the stall is resolved [30]. Rather than try to model these complex dynamics analytically, we incorporate two simple groups of fea- tures to assist the ML model with predicting the impact of pipeline stalls. First, we provide basic information about the extent of stalls: (i) the distribution of the number of ISBs in our windows of 𝑘con- secutive instructions; (ii) the distribution of the count of the three branch types ( 3.1) per instruction window, (iii) the overall branch misprediction rate obtained from trace analysis. Additionally, we provide the overall throughput calculated by our analytical ROB model ( 3.2.1) for varying ROB sizes, ROB {1,2,4,8,...,1024}. The intuition behind this feature is that pipeline stalls effectively reduce theaverageoccupancyoftheROB,loweringthebackendthroughput of the CPU pipeline. Therefore, the ROB model s estimate of how throughput varies versus ROB size can provide valuable context for how sensitive a program s performance is to pipeline stalls.\n\n--- Segment 27 ---\nThe intuition behind this feature is that pipeline stalls effectively reduce theaverageoccupancyoftheROB,loweringthebackendthroughput of the CPU pipeline.

The model is a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (details in 4) that takes as input a concatenation of (i) the performance distributions corresponding to the target microarchitecture ( 3.2.1), (ii) the auxil- iary features ( 3.2.2), and (iii) a 20-dimensional vector of parameters ( p) representing the target microarchitecture (Table 1). We train the ML model on a dataset constructed by randomly sampling diverse program regions and microarchitectures. We simulate each sample program region and sample microarchitecture using the cycle-level simulator to collect the ground-truth target CPI. To train the ML model, we use a loss function that measures the relative magnitude of CPI prediction error, as follows: 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠( ˆ𝑦,𝑦) ˆ𝑦 𝑦 𝑦 , (7) where ˆ𝑦denotes the predicted CPI and𝑦denotes the CPI label. 4 Concorde s Implementation Details Trace analyzer and analytical models.

To precompute the performance features for a program, we run the trace analyzer for each mem- ory configuration to derive the Concorde trace, and then run the analytical models for all parameter values of each CPU resource independently.

Unless specified otherwise, Concorde uses a dataset with 789,024 data points for training, with an additional 48,472 unseen (test) data points reserved for evaluation. Every data point is con- structed by independently sampling a microarchitecture, and a 100k- instruction region. To sample a microarchitecture, we independently pick a random value from Table 1 for every parameter. Concorde s large microarchitecture space ( 2 1023) ensures that test microar- chitectures are almost surely unseen during training, preventing memorization. To sample a program region, we sample a program from Table 2, sample a trace of the chosen program randomly with probability proportional to trace length, and sample a region ran- domly from this trace. Figure 4 shows the average overlap of test pro- gram regions with their closest training region (the training region with maximum instruction overlap) for every program. The overlap is 16.86 on average, and less than 10 for the majority of programs.

In the last column, we use one-hot vectors for the branch predictor type and the state of prefetching. We use the AdamW [56] optimizer with weight decay of 0.3, learning rate of 0.001 that halves after {10,14,18,22}k steps, and batch size of 50k to train for 1521 epochs. 5The size weighted distribution is a transformation of the original distribution of a non-negative random variable in which we weight every sample by its value. This transform highlights the tail of the original distribution. 7 A.

To highlight the gen- eralization capability of Concorde across microarchitectures, we first evaluate its accuracy on the unseen test split of the dataset ( 4), where microarchitectures are randomly sampled.

Furthermore, the errors do not correlate well with the per program train test overlaps in Figure 4. For instance, Concorde s average error is less than 1 for S4 and S6, and only slightly over 1 for P12, all of which have train test overlaps less than 3.5 .

Recall that one of the main design goals of Concorde is to avoid a run time cost that scales with the number of instructions (O(𝐿)). Hence, unlike cycle-level simulators that operate on sequence of instructions, Concorde takes as input a fixed- size performance characterization of the program independent of the program length. To evaluate Concorde on longer program re- gions, we create a new dataset similar to the original one ( 4) with longer program regions of 1M instructions and re-train Concorde on it. Figure 7 shows the distribution of Concorde s relative CPI prediction error over the unseen test split of this dataset (solid green line). The average error is 1.75 and only 1.82 of cases have larger than 10 error, which is slightly better than Concorde s accuracy on the original 100k-instruction region dataset (dashed blue line). We hypothesize that this is because the average CPI has less variability over longer regions due to the phase behaviors getting averaged out (which we confirmed by comparing the CPI variance in the two cases). This reduced variance makes the learning task easier for longer regions, boosting Concorde s accuracy. Accuracy on ARM N1. To assess Concorde s accuracy on a realis- tic microarchitecture, we evaluate its CPI predictions for ARM N1 (Table 1), using the 100k-instruction regions in the test split of our dataset ( 4). It has an average error of 3.25 with 4.39 of program regions having errors larger than 10 , which is a slight degrada- tion in the accuracy compared to random microarchitectures. We believe that this is because randomly sampled microarchitectures are more likely to have a single dominant bottleneck while ARM N1 is designed to be balanced. Comparison with TAO [71].\n\n--- Segment 34 ---\nWe believe that this is because randomly sampled microarchitectures are more likely to have a single dominant bottleneck while ARM N1 is designed to be balanced. Comparison with TAO [71]. We compare Concorde with TAO, the previous SOTA in sequence-based approximate performance modeling. Unlike Concorde, TAO does not generalize without addi- tional retraining beyond a single microarchitecture. Hence, we train it for ARM N1 on a dataset of 100M randomly sampled instructions from SPEC2017 programs (Table 2). Figure 8 compares TAO s CPI prediction accuracy on 100𝑘-instruction regions from SPEC2017 programs with Concorde s; Concorde is more accurate for every single program. This is despite the fact that Concorde is trained on random microarchitectures whereas TAO is specialized to ARM N1. Accuracy on long programs.

As an example, we use the 1M-instruction region model to predict the CPI for programs with 1B instructions. Figure 9 shows Concorde s accuracy in predicting CPI for ARM N1, across ten such 1B-instruction programs, with four sampling levels.

Figure 10 shows the running time distribution of Concordeandourgem5-basedcycle-levelsimulator.Wemeasurethe running time of Concorde and the cycle-level simulator on a single CPU core. For these experiments, we simulate from the first instruc- tion of each trace, to avoid extra warmup overheads for the cycle- level simulator. The average running time of Concorde (solid blue) is 168𝜇sec. Compared to our cycle-level simulator, Concorde achieves an average speedup of more than 2 105 for 1M-instruction regions. Furthermore, Concorde s running time does not change with the length of the instruction region (e.g., 100k 1M) since the size of its input distributions are fixed. In contrast, the cycle-level simulator s running time scales with the program region length, e.g., 487 by increasing the length from 1M (green) to 1B (red) instructions. Recall that to estimate the CPI of 1B-instruction programs in Figure 9, we used Concorde s predictions on randomly sampled 1M-instruction regions. The dashed dotted line in Figure 10 shows the running time distribution for processing 100 samples, measured on the same CPU. Even with 100 sequential samples, Concorde s average running time (1.7𝑚sec) is about 107 times faster than the cycle-level simulator for programs with 1B instructions. Additionally, the running time of the cycle-level simulator exhibits a high variance due to its dependence on the number of cycle-level events, which varies with programs and microarchitectures.

Recall from 5.1 that Concorde has a small error tail, where tail is defined as cases with larger than 10 error. Here, we detail our attempts to understand some of the factors responsible for the tail. Discrepancy in raw execution times. Recall that Concorde s ana- lytical models use approximate instruction execution times derived in trace analysis ( 3.1). As we discussed in 3.1, these estimated executions times can differ from the actual values observed during timing simulations. Figure 11 (left) shows the distribution of the ratio of the actual instruction execution times in timing simulations to their estimates from trace analysis, across 100k-instruction regions in our test dataset ( 4). More than 10 of program regions have a ratio larger than 1.5. These discrepancies can occur for a variety of reasons, including memory congestion, partial store forwarding, etc. that we do not account for in trace analysis. With high errors in their raw inputs, our analytical models will be inaccurate. We bucketize program regions based on the above ratio into three buckets, and plot Concorde s prediction error distribution for samples in each bucket (Figure 11, right). The result shows that Concorde s prediction error increases for the buckets with larger execution time discrepancy. But its accuracy remains quite high, even with significant discrepancies, e.g., achieving an average error of 4.53 in cases with ratio larger than 1.5.\n\n--- Segment 37 ---\nThe result shows that Concorde s prediction error increases for the buckets with larger execution time discrepancy. But its accuracy remains quite high, even with significant discrepancies, e.g., achieving an average error of 4.53 in cases with ratio larger than 1.5. This shows that the ML component of Concorde can correct for significant errors in the ana- lytical models. Nonetheless, errors in execution time estimates from trace analysis account for a large portion of the tail of Concorde s er- ror distribution. Among test program regions that have errors larger than 10 , 41.5 have execution time ratios larger than 1.5 (whereas only about 10 of all program regions have a ratio larger than 1.5). Branch prediction. Recall from 3.2 that unlike other CPU compo- nents, Concorde does not analytically model branch mispredictions. Instead, it relies on a set of auxiliary features that are helpful for learning the effect of pipeline stalls. We will show in 5.2.2 that these features indeed boost Concorde s overall accuracy. Here, we study whether branch mispredictions are another source of Concorde s errortail.Table4categorizesConcorde saccuracybasedonthenum- ber of branch mispredictions in 100k-instruction regions of the test dataset ( 4). Intriguingly, Concorde s accuracy improves as the num- ber of mispredictions increases, with an average error of 1.82 in regions with over 5,000 branch mispredictions. We hypothesize that this is because programs with large number of stalls have low paral- lelism and simpler dynamics, making them easier to predict. This re- sult confirms that Concorde s branch-related features are sufficient. 9 A. Nasr-Esfahany et al. Table 4: Concorde successfully learns the effect of branch prediction.

Recall from 3.2.2 that Concorde uses a few auxiliary features to augment the primary per-component through- put distributions. We train several variants of Concorde to under- stand the impact of these features. For reference, we begin with a simple minimum over the per-component throughput bounds (no ML). As shown by the pink line in Figure 12, this has poor accu- racy, achieving an average error of 65 (and 11 in cases with no branch misprediction). Concorde s base ML model, which takes as input the per-component throughput distributions along with the branch misprediction rate, significantly boosts accuracy (red line), achieving an average error of 3.32 with errors exceeding 10 in only 4.48 of cases. Further adding the auxiliary features ( 3.2.2) related to pipeline stalls (green) and instruction latency distributions (blue) provides incremental accuracy improvements, reducing av- erage error to 2.4 and 2.03 and the percentage of samples with errors larger than 10 to 3.7 and 2.51 , respectively. In addition, we ablated the ML model size, and the choice of 𝑘, the length of instruction windows for throughput calculations ( 3.2). Expanding the model to three hidden layers of sizes 512, 256, and 128 slightly lowers the average error on random microarchitectures from 2.03 to 1.85 , while reducing it to a single hidden layer of size 256 increases the error to 3.91 .

Precomputing the performance features for a 1M-instruction region for all the 2.2 1023 parameter combina- tions in Table 1 takes 3959 seconds on a single CPU core equivalent to the time required for 107 cycle-level simulations with similar warmup. This includes 195s for trace analysis ( 3.1) and 3764s for analytical modeling ( 3.2). Trace analysis comprises one TAGE, 40 D-cache, and 20 I-cache simulations. The dominant factors in ana- lytical modeling are 40 1024 ROB model invocations (3327s) and 40 256 invocations of the Load Store queue models (211s 211s). The precomputed performance features occupy 24MB in uncompressed NumPy [38] format. Table 1 sweeps all parameters in increments of 1, but such a fine granularity is typically not necessary in practice. Quantizing the pa- rameter space can significantly reduce the precomputation time. For example, considering powers of 2 for ROB, Load and Store queues, i.e, ROB {1,2,4,...,1024}, Load Store queue {1,2,4,...,256}, reduces 200 300 400 500 600 700 Training Dataset Size (k) 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 CPI Error ( ) Smaller dataset Full dataset Figure 13: Impact of training dataset size on Concorde s accuracy P12 P11 P1 P13 P4 P5 P10 P8 P6 P3 P7 P2 P9 C2 C1 O1 O3 O2 O4 S4 S6 S5 S8 S9 S2 S7 S3 S1 S10 5 10 15 CPI Error ( ) 26 4203 40 32 128 512 2048 8192 Number of seen new program samples 5 10 15 20 25 CPI Error ( ) S1 C2 O4 O3 Figure 14: Errors can be high on unseen programs (top).

Techniques like QEMU [12] could further reduce trace analysis time [25]. 5.2.4 Training cost. ML training takes 3 hours on a TPU-v3-8 [1] cloud server with 8 TensorCores (2.7 hours on an AMD EYPC Milan processor with 64 cores). To generate the training dataset ( 4), we only run trace analysis and analytical modeling for one (randomly selected) microarchitecture for each program region. Using 512 cores, it takes 19.4 hours to create the more expensive 1M-instructionregiondatasetwith837,496datapoints.Thisincludes 16.8 hours for cycle-level simulations (to generate the CPI labels), 2.2 hours for trace analysis, and 26 minutes for analytical modeling. Although training is a one-time cost, it can be reduced at a slight degradation in model accuracy. Figure 13 shows that reducing the training dataset size to 200k samples gradually increases the relative CPI error from 2.01 to 3.07 . Further reduction to 100k samples increases the error to 4.67 . 5.2.5 Out-of-Distribution(OOD)Generalization. LikeanyMLmodel, we expect Concorde to be trained on a diverse dataset of programs representative of programs of interest. However, to stress test pro- gram generalization, for every program, we train Concorde on a dataset that excludes all its traces and evaluate the accuracy of the resulting model on that program. Figure 14 (top) shows the average OOD error for all programs. As expected, the error increases, with some programs being affected more than others. 23 programs (blue) have OOD error below 10 . The 3 programs with the highest error (red) are synthetic microbenchmarks testing specific microarchitec- tural capabilities. These programs are unlike any other in the dataset. For instance, O3 (a memory test), has much higher CPIs compared 10 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion to other programs in Table 2.\n\n--- Segment 41 ---\nThese programs are unlike any other in the dataset. For instance, O3 (a memory test), has much higher CPIs compared 10 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion to other programs in Table 2. The 3 remaining programs (orange), with OOD error of about 15 , are real workloads that stand out from the others. For example, as we will see in 6, S1 has the highest sensitivity to cache sizes among all workloads in Table 2. Compared to generalization across microarchitectures, OOD gen- eralization across programs is not a major concern. Programs and benchmarks used for CPU architecture exploration are relatively sta- ble. For example, SPEC CPU benchmarks are only updated every few years, and we similarly see infrequent updates to our internal suite of benchmarks. Nevertheless, we quantify the cost of onboarding new programs into Concorde for O3, O4 (2 highest red bars), and S1, C2 (2 highest orange bars). For each of these programs, we train Concorde on all other programs together with a varying number of samples from the new program. As Figure 14 (bottom) shows, 2k (8k) samples from the new program are enough for Concorde to reach within 5 (2 ) of the error floor achieved by the model trained on the full dataset with 30𝑘samples per program (Figure 6). O3 and O4 have the steepest drop in error, which is likely due to the regularity of these synthetic benchmarks. 5.2.6 Can Concorde predict metrics other than CPI? Although we focused on CPI in designing our analytical models, Concorde s rich performance distributions are useful for predicting other metrics as well. To illustrate this point, we retrain Concorde s ML model (without changing hyperparameters) to predict the average Rename queue occupancy ( ) and average ROB occupancy ( ), on the same datasetusedforCPI( 4).Onunseentestsamples,Concordeachieves an average prediction error of 2.50 and 2.23 , respectively, vs. the ground-truth metrics from our gem5-based simulator. 6 Fine-Grained Performance Attribution Beyond predicting performance, architects often need to understand why a program performs as it does on a certain design.\n\n--- Segment 42 ---\nTo illustrate this point, we retrain Concorde s ML model (without changing hyperparameters) to predict the average Rename queue occupancy ( ) and average ROB occupancy ( ), on the same datasetusedforCPI( 4).Onunseentestsamples,Concordeachieves an average prediction error of 2.50 and 2.23 , respectively, vs. the ground-truth metrics from our gem5-based simulator. 6 Fine-Grained Performance Attribution Beyond predicting performance, architects often need to understand why a program performs as it does on a certain design. In this section, we present a methodology for fine-grained attribution of perfor- mance to different microarchitectural components. Our method can be used in conjunction with any performance model𝑦 𝑓( x, p) relat- ingmicroarchitecturalparameterstoperformance.Butaswewillsee, it is computationally impractical for expensive models such as cycle- level simulators. Concorde s massive speedup over conventional methods makes such large-scale, fine-grained analyses possible. Concretely, our goal is to quantify the relative impact of different microarchitectural parameters p on the performance of a program x. This requires identifying the dominant performance bottlenecks. Manyexistingperformanceanalysistechniques(e.g.,Top-Down[92], CPI stacks [29]) rely on hardware performance counters to identify bottlenecks. We seek to obtain similar insights using only a perfor- mance model𝑦 𝑓( x, p) like Concorde that outputs the (predicted) performance of a program given the microarchitectural parameters. Performance of a single microarchitecture p provides no information about which of the parameters𝑝𝑖are important. Thus, we use param- eter ablations, where we change some parameters and observe their impact on performance. Intuitively, parameters that have a large ef- fect on performance when modified are more important. Parameter ablations are commonly used to understand the impact of design choices [23, 37, 67, 91].\n\n--- Segment 43 ---\nIntuitively, parameters that have a large ef- fect on performance when modified are more important. Parameter ablations are commonly used to understand the impact of design choices [23, 37, 67, 91].

After each parameter change, the incremental change in performance is reported as the contribution of that param- eter to the total performance difference between p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒and p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡. Although this methodology is standard, it can be difficult to draw sound conclusions from parameter ablations when there are multi- ple inter-related factors effecting performance. The issue is that the order of parameter ablations can change the perceived importance of different factors. To illustrate, suppose we are interested in quan- tifying the relative impact of (i) limited cache size and (ii) limited Load queue size on a memory-intensive workload. As a baseline, we consider a big core with all parameters set to their largest value in Table 1, particularly: L1d L1i cache 256kB, L2d cache 4MB, and Load queue 256. Figure 15 shows the CPI achieved by this baseline (Grey bars) on a sample trace from the Search3 workload. Next, we consider two parameter ablations atop the baseline, where we reduce the cache sizes and the Load queue size to our tar- get values: L1d L1i cache 64kB, L2d cache 1MB, Load queue 12.\n\n--- Segment 44 ---\nFigure 15 shows the CPI achieved by this baseline (Grey bars) on a sample trace from the Search3 workload. Next, we consider two parameter ablations atop the baseline, where we reduce the cache sizes and the Load queue size to our tar- get values: L1d L1i cache 64kB, L2d cache 1MB, Load queue 12. In one ablation, we first reduce the cache sizes and then the Load queue size; in the other ablation, we reduce the Load queue size first, then reduce cache size. The two left bars in Figure 15 show the CPI trajectory for both routes, along with the CPI increase associated with reducing cache sizes and Load queue size in each case. The overlaid numbers show the percentage CPI increase relative to the baseline following each parameter change. The two orders of parameter ablations lead to entirely different conclusions.The(Cache Loadqueue)ordersuggeststhatreducing the Load queue size has about 9 larger impact than reducing the cachesizes. The(Load queue Cache)order,on theotherhand, says that reducing the Load queue has negligible effect and the perfor- mance degradation is almost entirely caused by reducing the cache sizes. Neither of these interpretations is correct. The reality is that the effects of cache and Load queue size are intertwined. A large Load queue can mitigate the performance hit of small caches for this workload (due to increased parallelism). Similarly, a large cache size can perform well despite a small Load queue (since Load instructions complete quickly). It is only when both the Load queue and cache sizes are small that we incur a large performance hit. Shapley value: a fair, order-independent attribution. A natural way to remove the bias caused by a specific order of parameter ab- lations is to consider the average of all possible orders. Let Π denote the set of all permutations of the parameter indices 𝐷 {1,...,𝑑}. Each permutation 𝜋 Π corresponds to one order of ablating the parameters from p𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒to p𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡, resulting in a different value for the incremental effect of modifying parameter 𝑖. 11 A.

Let 𝑘denote the position of parameter 𝑖in the order 𝜋. Then, the incremental effect of parameter 𝑖in order 𝜋is: Δ𝜋 𝑖 𝑓(x,p𝜋(k)) 𝑓(x,p𝜋(k-1)). To assign an overall attribution to parameter 𝑖, we take the average over all permutations: 𝜑𝑖 1 Π 𝜋 Π Δ𝜋 𝑖, (8) where Π 𝑑! is the total number of permutations. The quantity defined in Equation (8) is referred to as the Shapley value [78] in economics. The concept arises in cooperative game theory, where a group of 𝑀players work together to generate value 𝑣(𝑀). Shapley s seminal work showed that the Shapley value is a fair distribution of 𝑣(𝑀) among the players, in that it is the only way to divide 𝑣(𝑀) that satisfies certain desirable properties (refer to [78] for details).\n\n--- Segment 46 ---\nThe concept arises in cooperative game theory, where a group of 𝑀players work together to generate value 𝑣(𝑀).

In our context, the players are the different microarchitectural components, and the value to be divided is the performance difference between the baseline and target microarchi- tectures.6 The Shapley value is used in many areas of science and engineering [5, 13, 33, 60, 64 66], but to our knowledge, we are the first to apply it to performance attribution in computer architecture. The rightmost bar in Figure 15 shows the Shapley values cor- responding to cache and Load queue sizes in the above example. The Shapley value correctly captures that small caches and small Load queue sizes are together the culprit for high CPI relative to the baseline, with a slightly larger attribution to small caches.

To illustrate Shapley value analysis, we use it for fine- grained performance attribution in a target design based on the ARM N1 core [73] (parameters in Table 1) across our entire pool of pro- grams.

This provides a bird s eye view of the dominant per- formance bottlenecks across the entire corpus of workloads. For instance, all the proprietary programs and half of the SPEC2017 programs are mainly backend bound on ARM N1, with prominent bottlenecks being the Load queue size and ROB size. A few programs such as S4(541.leela_r) (a chess engine using tree search) are frontendbound,withtheTAGEbranchpredictorthemostprominent frontend bottleneck. Cache sizes and L1 prefetching have a large effect on some SPEC2017 benchmarks (e.g., S10(502.gcc_r), S1) but a less pronounced impact on our proprietary workloads, perhaps in indication of our programs being cache-optimized.

Conventional simulators [3, 4, 6, 11, 15, 19, 22, 28, 32, 34, 42, 63, 69, 72, 74, 75, 84, 94, 95] aim to balance speed and accuracy, leveraging higher abstraction levels [19, 32], or decoupled simulations of core and shared resources [28, 75]. While these methods achieve faster simulations, they often compromise flexibility or accuracy. Hardware-accelerated simulators [22, 47] im- prove speed but require extensive development effort for validation. Statistical modeling tools [27, 36, 46, 79 81, 90] reduce computation bysamplingrepresentativesegments[80,90]orgeneratingsynthetic traces [26, 68], but they trade off flexibility and detailed insights. Analytical performance models. Analytical models [2, 21, 41, 48, 49, 86, 87] provide quick performance estimates using parameterized equations and microarchitecture-independent profiling. Such meth- ods are ideal for crude design space exploration but often lack the granularity needed to capture intricate 𝜇-architectural dynamics. 12 Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion ML- and DL-based performance models. Conventional ML based models [24, 43 45, 51 53, 76, 89, 96] predict performance over con- strained design spaces but often struggle with fine-grained program- hardware interactions. In contrast, Concorde demonstrates robust generalization across unseen programs and microarchitectures. Re- cent DL-based models [20, 54, 61, 70, 71, 83, 93] improve modeling at a higher abstraction levels at the cost of higher compute.\n\n--- Segment 50 ---\nIn contrast, Concorde demonstrates robust generalization across unseen programs and microarchitectures. Re- cent DL-based models [20, 54, 61, 70, 71, 83, 93] improve modeling at a higher abstraction levels at the cost of higher compute. Notably, PerfVec[54] (significant training overhead) and TAO[71] (additional finetuning for unseen configurations) emphasize per-instruction embeddings. Our work diverges by compactly capturing program- level performance characteristics using analytical models and fusing themwithalightweightMLmodelforcapturingdynamicbehaviors. 8 Final Remarks The key lesson from Concorde is that decomposing performance models into simple analytical representations of individual microar- chitectural components, fused together by an ML model capturing higher-order complexities, is very effective. It enables a method that is both extremely fast and accurate. Before concluding, we remark on some limitations of our work and directions for future research. Concorde does not obviate the need for detailed simulation. It en- ables large-scale design-space explorations not possible with current methods (e.g., Shapley value analysis ( 6)), but some analyses will inevitably require more detailed models. Moreover, Concorde needs training data to learn the impact of design changes (e.g., different parameters), which we currently obtain using a reference cycle-level simulator. In principle, Concorde could be trained on data from any reference platform, including emulators and real hardware. As an ML approach, Concorde s accuracy is inherently statistical. Our results show high accuracy for a vast majority of predictions, but there is a small tail of cases with high errors. We have analyzed some of the causes of these errors ( 5.2.1), and we believe that further improvements to the analytical models (e.g., explicitly modeling in- memorycongestion)canfurtherreducethetail.Butwedonotexpect that tail cases can be eliminated entirely. Alternatively, a large set of techniques exist for quantifying the uncertainty of such ML mod- els [9, 10, 31]. Future work on providing confidence bounds would allow designers to detect predictions with high potential errors and crosscheck them with other tools. Finally, Concorde was just one example of our compositional analytical-ML modeling approach.\n\n--- Segment 51 ---\nFuture work on providing confidence bounds would allow designers to detect predictions with high potential errors and crosscheck them with other tools. Finally, Concorde was just one example of our compositional analytical-ML modeling approach. We believe that the methodology is broadly applicable and we hope that future work will extend it to other use cases, such as modeling multi-threaded systems, uncore components, and other architectures (e.g., accelerators).
