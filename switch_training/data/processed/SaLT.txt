Unlike their compute architecture, storage and archival system for these edge servers has often been under-emphasized. This is unfortunate as they contribute significantly to the data management and data movement, especially in a emerging complute landscape where date storage and data protection has be- come one of the key concerns. To mitigate this, we propose Salient Store that specifically focuses on the integration of Computational Storage Devices (CSDs) into edge servers to enhance data processing and management, particularly in continuous learning scenarios, prevalent in fields such as autonomous driving and urban mobility. Our research, gos beyond the compute domain, and identifies the gaps in current storage system designs. We proposes a framework that aligns more closely with the growing data demands. We present a detailed analysis of data movement challenges within the archival workflows and demonstrate how the strategic integration of CSDs can significantly optimize data compression, encryption, as well as other data management tasks, to improve overall system performance. By leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs and the high internal bandwidth of SSDs, Salient Store reduces the communication latency and data volume by 6.2 and 6.1 , respectively. This paper pro- vides a comprehensive overview of the potential of CSDs to revolutionize storage, making them not just data repositories but active participants in the computational process. 1 Introduction Video analytics, powered by deep neural networks (DNNs) has become the key component of multiple applications including but not limited to autonomous driving (Brown et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023), urban mobility (Corporation; Custom On-Device ML Models with Learn2Compress), surveillance and monitoring (Bozcan Kayacan, 2020; Dutta Ekenna, 2019; Pichierri et al., 2023), video streaming and conferencing (Dasari et al., 2022b; Cheng et al., 2024; Sivaraman et al., 2024), telemedicine (Wan et al., 2020), and tourism (Zhu et al., 2024; Pierdicca et al., 2021; Godovykh et al., 2022). While some of these applications rely on collecting the video data and processing them offline, many need real-time analytics for the seamless integration, operation and effectiveness of the task at hand (Bramberger et al., 2004; Apostolo et al., 2022; Grulich Nawab, 2018). Moreover, depending on the deployment, scenario and requirements, some of these applications also demand learning to keep up with the data drift (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Rebuffi et al., 2017). However, regulations, resource limitations and privacy concerns often mandate these applications (both learning and inference) to be performed at the edge (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024). For example, many of the European cities restrict the traffic video data to be streamed to the cloud (www.dlapiperdataprotection.com; Achieving Compliant Data Residency and Security with Azure; Bhardwaj et al., 2022), which enforces performing video Preprint.

The Shown storage pipeline is the preliminary focus of Salient Store . analytics and learning tasks related to urban mobility at the edge. This has lead to a significant development in the direction of enabling video analytics and learning with edge servers. Although efficient algorithms, compute orchestration and hardware have addressed the analytics part, the scaling of such a system becomes a problem primarily due to high energy consumption. Recent works try to solve this problem by augmenting these continuous learning edge servers with application-specific hardware targeted for intermittent computing which could run using solar power. However, all these works focus on the analytics part while overlooking one critical aspect: what happens to all those video data after the analytics? Data Archival: The answer is straightforward, especially for mission-critical public records like urban mobility and surveillance data: these need to be archived in a local storage to avoid under- mining the benefits of edge computation, i.e. minimizing communication and preserving privacy. However, managing such data requires substantial storage infrastructure. For instance, storing a full day s worth of 1080p video at 60fps requires (1920 1080 3 pixels 4 bytes per pixel 60 frames per second 3600 24)117.32 TiB of raw video data, which compresses to approximately 60 GiB to 400 GiB of encoded data per day. Including redundancy, this requires an additional 33 to 100 more storage capacity. Furthermore, given the plug-and-play nature of storage media like HDDs and SSDs, securing this data becomes even more critical. The typical archival process involves three key phases: compression, encryption, and redundancy. Fig. 1 illustrates the data flow in an edge server, where video data are first encoded (using H264 or similar codecs), then encrypted (with RSA or similar standards), and finally stored across a distributed set of disks to ensure redundancy (e.g., RAID 5). These processes create a complex data-flow pipeline, differentiating two streams of video data: one for real-time inference and training, and another for archival. This dual-stream processing consumes considerable system resources such as CPU, memory, and energy, further complicating the management for intermittently powered systems like Us.Ã¡s (Mishra et al., 2024) where data integrity and security must be maintained during power disruptions 1. Table 1 provides an estimation of resource utilization on commercial systems underscoring the fact that compressing, encrypting and reliably storing the data, especially for (intermittent) edge servers is a bigger challenge in contrast to classical cloud storage servers. The Challenges: In edge computing architectures, the lack of data reuse between the analytics and video data archival poses significant challenges. Classically, video data is streamed simultaneously to compute and storage systems for various processing tasks, such as inference, exemplar selection, and storage, thereby increasing I O bandwidth and system processing demands. This processing complexity necessitates substantial compute and memory resources, escalating power consumption 1Management and retrieval of data typically utilize a vector database like file-system, although this is beyond the scope of this discussion. 2 Data Task Algorithm CPU Utilization DRAM Utilization 16 Core Xeon Peak Average All Encryptions RSA512 2.18 14.56 5.85 All Decryptions RSA512 3.45 17.2 6.12 3D PC Compression OctTree 26.78 78.2 32.54 Inflation OctTree 29.24 81.56 36.18 Video Compression ZStd 24.7 62.54 24.5 Inflation ZStd 22.6 79.18 29.43 Compression H264 12.85 52.46 21.4 Inflation H264 14.2 69.46 26.18 All (un)RAID Unraid 11.25 29.4 19.24 Table 1: Resource utilization while running different algorithms under classical data archival pipeline for multiple data modalities in an AWS h1.4xlarge storage-optimized instance. (e.g., systems with CPUs having a thermal design power of 145W and 64GB of DRAM as noted in Table 1) and requiring larger form factors, which exceed the capabilities of intermittent systems and challenge sustainability goals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to minimize compute and power requirements in archival processes. Moreover, the divergence of analytics and archival pipelines from the outset suggests that optimizing both hardware, software and data-flow used in inference, learning and archival could significantly enhance throughput and energy efficiency. This can be achieved by using modern neural compression algorithms instead of the classical encoding algorithm. However, the neural compression algorithm needs to be compute efficient (reusing maximum analytics pipeline), have high compression ratio (need to compete with H264) and feature rich (could be decompressed and retrieved with a reasonable loss). Furthermore, it needs to take advantage of the data similarity between frames to further minimize the storage footprint, and thereby reducing the form factor and need of frequent disk swapping maintenance. The second challenge comes from privacy and security of sensitive data. Considering the cheap commodity use storage devices are often plug and play, they are often vulnerable for data leak, especially if they are deployed in public, like urban mobility setting. Unlike secure data centers, these federated, distributed and public deployment could be susceptible to direct physical attacks for data breach. Although modern encryption algorithms like RSA are secure, there is still a threat of store now decrypt later2 kind of attack (National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), 2023). To mitigate this, quantum safe encryption algorithms needs to be used without hindering the throughput. Furthermore, the design needs to be programmable to ensure encryption keys to be changed regularly for additional security. Solution Space and Our Work: This paper proposes Salient Store , a novel storage solution designed for continuous learning edge servers by incorporating a hardware-software co-design framework that allows for efficient data archival and storage. Salient Store utilizes the state-of- the-art neural compression which partially uses the inference exemplar selection pipeline along with layered neural codecs to compress the video data. It also uses the motion vectors as a latent space to effectively use the inter-frame similarity, thereby further increasing the compression ratio. Salient Store also provides a hardware accelerated lattice-based quantum safe encryption mechanism. To tightly integrate these solutions to the storage space, while providing data security, Salient Store uses computational storage devices (CSDs) (AMD, b) which reduce the energy consumption while keeping the compute pipeline unaltered. Our main contributions include: We propose design of a hybrid storage pipeline equipped with computational storage drives (CSDs) where the different drives could communicate with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion. These CSDs synergistically orchestrate the archival related tasks between the storage controller CPU and the computational storage FPGAs. The hybrid storage system is capable of taking the computed 2Given a powerful enough computer like quantum computers, RSA encrypted data can be decrypted, and therefore National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) called for proposals to develop post quantum cryptography algorithms (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2024), and defined a standard for the same. One of the successful submissions which was later defined as a standard uses lattice-based encryption algorithm (Micciancio Regev, 2009) and will be the focus of our work. 3 frame features and the motion vectors from the compute hardware to perform a novel layered neural compression. We discuss the storage data-flow, the compute orchestration and mapping in the proposed system. This includes a hardware software co-design for compute-intensive applications along with map- ping different functions to different hardware in the data pipeline. Furthermore, we add failure management support for the intermittent edge servers. We go beyond the compute and look into future-proofing the storage server by equipping it with quantum safe lattice-based encryption technique. We maximize the hardware utilization by reusing compute kernels from the compression pipeline. We detail the design of the hardware accelerated encryption and maximize the resource reuse between the exemplar selection and encryption. Finally we perform an in-depth exploration of this integration, supported by real-world data from domains such as autonomous driving and urban mobility, to illustrate its effectiveness in continuous learning scenarios. The proposed design provides 2.2 latency and 5.6 data movement benefits compared to the state-of-the-art, on a single storage and 4.8 latency benefit in a multi-node system. 2 Background and Motivation 2.1 Storage for Continuous Learning Edge Servers Recent developments in continuous learning for video analytics (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024) has significantly boosted the capabilities and accuracy of learning systems. The major focus of these works have been building compute platforms with efficient scheduling (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024), and reconfigurable hardware design (Kim et al., 2024; Mishra et al., 2024). This solves majority of the bottlenecks in a performance-driven classical cloud server platform. However, video analytics for many applications (Corporation; Custom On-Device ML Models with Learn2Compress; Wright"; "premioinc") are moving towards the edge. Therefore, managing and storing the hefty volume of video data brings more challenge due to the energy, compute and form-factor limitations. Modern and upcoming applications like urban mobility and autonomous driving are predicted to be generating hundreds of exabytes of data (Urban Traffic Dataset; Corporation; Wright"; "premioinc") per year while increasingly being deployed at the edge calling for a robust, secure, and efficient infrastructure for storing data at the edge while needing occasional human intervention for maintenance. Using State-of-the-Art Video Data Storage? Maybe Not: While storing video data as files works for small systems, in very large-scale systems they are typically stored using vector databases (Shen et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2024). Vector databases typically extract features from the video data to form index and those indices are then sorted using various metrics like neighborhood, maximum similarity, etc. (Fonseca Jorge, 2003; Cao et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2023; Douze et al., 2024) for faster retrieval. The vector index are used to point to the meta-data of the video file and then the actual video data is retrieved from the storage (Shen et al., 2005). This approach helps context-based search like looking for particular objects, events, or attributes (Douze et al., 2024). However, it is obvious that this approach, albeit good for streaming and retrieval, are not entirely space-efficient, and at times can increase the data volume by many folds (Douze et al., 2024). In an edge server where we are only worried about storage and not retrieval3, the vector database approach is not effective. Rather, storing the data in a compressed and encrypted format (with redundancies) is more efficient and therefore is the focus of our work. Why Not the Usual Process? Now that we know Classical approach of video data storage involves encoding and encrypting the video data before storing them in a redundant storage array (Huang Xu, 2014; Fan et al., 2022; Korkiakangas, 2014; Yue et al., 2016) which consumes significant resources (refer Table 1). Even though there have been significant research in accelerating both compression (Collet Kucherawy, 2018; Chen et al., 2021) and encryption (Milanov, 2009; Rawat et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015), operating on large-scale video data often demands more resource than what edge servers could afford (Mishra et al., 2024). Co-locating this compute along with the inference and training would definitely hinder the critical path. 3We assume the data to be eventually available in the data repository, where they can be properly stored for efficient lookup. This can be done by periodically transporting the data by swapping out storage bays. Our goal is to maximize storage at edge so that the frequency of maintenance decreases. 4 The main reason these algorithms consume significant resources is because of the amount of data they handle. Every single 1920 1080 raw frame prior to encoding carries 23MiB of data which, 60fps, will require processing 1.4GiB of data per second per imaging source. This pipeline assumes the use of classical data encoding algorithms like H2644 which requires all the frames to encode a video stream, albeit it only saves the essential information. Therefore, it does not use any of the computations that are used in the inference and learning pipeline. Then, the question is: is there a way we can reuse the computations used for the inference to help us in encoding the data? The answer is neural codecs (Ma et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017). Neural Codecs DNNs for Compression: Neural codecs represent a paradigm shift in video com- pression technology, leveraging the capabilities of deep learning to optimize both encoding and decoding processes. Unlike traditional codecs that rely on predefined algorithms to compress video data, neural codecs utilize an end-to-end trainable system based on neural networks. These networks are trained on extensive video datasets, allowing them to dynamically adapt compression strategies based on the content s complexity and prevailing network conditions. The architectural backbone of neural codecs typically comprises an autoencoder, where the encoder compresses the video into a compact, lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs it back into video format. These blocks can be stacked over each other to form layered codecs (like SHVC and SVC). This process benefits significantly from residual learning techniques, where each successive layer in the network aims to correct errors from the previous layers, thereby enhancing the reconstructed video quality incrementally with each additional decoding layer. Moreover, neural codecs excel in adaptability, offering robust performance across variable bandwidth and computational conditions, making them particularly suited for real-time streaming environments. These codecs can operate on generic computational hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, without the need for specialized video processing units, thus broadening their applicability across different device platforms. This adaptability also extends to content delivery dynamics, where neural codecs can adjust the streaming quality in real-time, responding adeptly to fluctuations in network throughput and variations in device capabilities. Such capabilities not only enhance user experience by minimizing buffering and maximizing video quality but also optimize bandwidth usage, presenting a cost-effective solution for content providers. These technical advancements position neural codecs as potential game-changers in the video streaming industry (NVIDIA Corporation, 2024), promising significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in various streaming scenarios. One major issue with neural codecs are their lack of utilization of inter-frame similarity. Classically, neural codecs compress each frame by treating them like images. However, video data often comes with a large amount of inter-frame similarity (Ying et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2020, 2021; Ying et al., 2022a). This similarity could be exploited, like in classical encoding algorithms, to further increase the compression ratio while improving the feature quality. Furthermore, neural codecs offer us the flexibility to approximate the computation (using quantization) to further enhance efficiency. Since they also use the computation blocks of the standard neural network, they can be jointly trained along with the classifier network to perform as the feature extraction and encoding backbone, thereby maximizing the utilization of the inference pipeline, and reducing the computation needed for compression. This maximizes data and resource reuse, and the pipeline for inference and compression do not diverge from the get going. However, even with data reuse, performing compression using neural codecs would require extra compute resources, energy and latency, hindering the critical path, i.e., inference. However, this issue could be alleviated by not using the compute resource in the critical path and preferably moving the compute to the storage where the data will eventually be stored. This is where the modern and upcoming computational storage devices (CSDs) come to rescue: bringing computation closer to data while providing with maximum energy efficiency and programmability (Newsroom; AMD, b). However, storage systems are not typically built to cater towards the ML applications, and now that compression becomes a ML application with the use of stacked neural codecs, building the right storage stack along with computational storage devices becomes an important problem. Evolution of Computational Storage: The advent of CSDs represents a paradigm shift, bringing computation closer to storage. These devices, by integrating CPUs or FPGAs into the storage 4We do not consider H265 here as currently in commercial systems H264 is the standard and typically enjoys hardware support. Moreover, H265 is an extension of H264 with additional features like coding tree units and intra-prediction directions which demand significantly more computation. 5 medium, facilitate computation at the storage level. Initial applications of CSDs were confined to tasks like encryption decryption, RAID, and compression. However, there has been a significant push towards enabling more complex workloads, including query processing on CSDs. Efforts to adapt CSDs for machine learning applications, albeit limited in scope to classical learning and data management, mark a crucial step forward. Yet, the expansion of these technologies to encompass large-scale storage stacks and the integration of CSDs into conventional storage systems, particularly for ML applications, remains a significant challenge and an open area of research. Bridging the Gap in Storage System Design: There is a discernible gap in the design and concep- tualization of storage drives, systems and servers, especially in the context of ML applications. Historically, researchers have investigated these components individually, often focusing on high- performance computing, scientific computing, and database applications. However, the specific demands of ML applications on storage systems have largely been overlooked. storage stack archi- tects often abstract the computational processes, neglecting considerations such as data movement cost, compute cost, and power requirements. Conversely, architects of storage drives, including CSDs, tend to overlook the broader application requirements, such as data prioritization, potential offloading of computational tasks to storage, and application-specific data compression and encryption strategies. Our research aims to bridge this gap, focusing specifically on the exigencies of continuous learning applications. 2.2 The Problem: Understanding the Data Flow Challenges in Data Movement: In both consumer applications and high-performance computing (HPC) programs, the process of data collection followed by analytics is a critical operation (Cao et al., 2020; Mailthody et al., 2019; Chapman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023). The efficiency of data movement significantly influences the performance and energy consumption of large-scale systems (Park et al.). As earlier discussions highlighted, applications on edge servers need to store generated data on storage stacks. These data are can then be moved to a central facility where they can be further treated for efficient retrieval ans on demand streaming. Urban Mobility A Case Study in Continuous Learning: To thoroughly understand this data flow, let us examine urban mobility , a prevalent continuous learning task (Bhardwaj et al., 2022). This task dynamically adapts to changing traffic patterns and environmental conditions. In urban mobility, high-volume data streams from multiple sources, such as high-resolution traffic cameras, are first compressed then analyzed for exemplar selection. This process involves representation learning (Rebuffi et al., 2017), where data is transformed into feature vectors using deep neural networks, followed by unsupervised learning techniques like k-means clustering. The goal is to identify unique or new classes of data for training while archiving known classes. In exemplar selection, the entire dataset is analyzed to detect classes with unique features, i.e., the images that are much different from the training data distribution or new classes that were not included in the training data. This is typically achieved through representation learning (Rebuffi et al., 2017) where the data is first converted into a feature vectors using the convolution layers of a large DNN model (or multiples of them), and then performing an unsupervised learning based classification, e.g., k-means (Arthur Vassilvitskii, 2007; Bahmani et al., 2012), to cluster the data. It is noteworthy that, the process of neural compression as well as inference representation learning use the feature extraction method. In this work, our goal is to use this to our advantage and maximize the compute and data reuse. The critical insight to be gleaned here is reusing data and compute pipeline prior to its transfer to storage could markedly diminish the costs associated with data movement. This approach would notably minimize the consumption of bandwidth and latency and curtail the compute requirements, thereby ensuring that the compute server s resources are judiciously employed only for indispensable computations. This strategic compute-reuse could help in optimizing the efficiency and efficacy of computational operations, especially in large scale data intensive and data driven applications. 2.3 Why Not More Compute at Storage Stacks? Integrating additional compute capabilities within storage stacks to offload certain computational tasks may seem an intuitive solution to the problem at hand. Theoretically, storage stacks could handle operations like unRAID and decryption, and extend their functionality to data inflation and 6 feature extraction. This would ostensibly allow for the selective transfer of only pertinent exemplar data to compute servers, thereby optimizing data movement costs. However, this approach presents several challenges. Current storage stacks are outfitted with robust CPUs and memory systems, which are heavily tasked with state-of-the-art storage management algorithms, as evidenced by the resource utilization outlined in TABLE 1. These algorithms already consume substantial compute and memory resources, often to the extent of fully occupying the storage controller system, with a portion of resources being allocated for essential system stack operations. Furthermore, incorporating more advanced compute hardware, such as FPGAs, GPGPUs and other accelerators, would lead to underutilized I O slots and memory, consequently escalating the cost of storage systems. Additionally, storage solutions that are optimized for I O throughput tend to lose their specialized efficiency when repurposed for general compute tasks (Haynes et al., 2021). While the previous research has suggested the idea of integrating analytics into storage systems, these discussions usually revolve around system architecture, scheduling, and data management, without delving into the requisite compute capabilities (Haynes et al., 2021; Daum et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2019). 2.4 More Compute in Storage? Why Not? Exploring the realm of computational storage drives presents a tantalizing avenue for on-disk com- puting capabilities. Storage controllers, typically constrained by I O bandwidth, are now being complemented by the vast internal bandwidth of solid-state drives (SSDs), making them prime candi- dates for near-data processing. Recent advances in both commercial (Newsroom; AMD, b; Mesnier, 2022; ScaleFlux, a,b; Eideticom Laboratory; Laboratory) and academic sectors (Torabzadehkashi et al., 2019b; Barbalace Do, 2021; Lukken Trivedi, 2021; Torabzadehkashi et al., 2019a; Sala- mat et al., 2021, 2022; Do et al., 2013) advocate the use of computational storage drives (CSDs) across databases, high-performance computing (HPC), and analytics. AMD and Xilinx have intro- duced specialized tools and libraries designed to harness CSDs (AMD, a; AMD Xilinx), enabling peer-to-peer PCIe transactions that bypass the CPU (AMD Xilinx). The emergence of Compute Express Link (CXL) technology (Sharma, 2022a,b; Jung, 2022) further amplifies the potential of disaggregated storage and memory systems. Decoupling compute tasks needed for storing the data from the host CPU and embedding them directly within storage devices, particularly through CSDs, has demonstrated significant performance and energy benefits. Tasks traditionally performed at the storage controller level are now being offloaded to CSDs, often accelerated using FPGA primitives (Kim et al., 2021; AMD Xilinx; AMD, a). Moreover, CSDs hold the potential to undertake critical machine learning tasks like feature extraction and clustering, streamlining tasks like neural compression. The unique combination of FPGAs parallel processing prowess, the substantial internal bandwidth of SSDs, and their block- accessible nature position CSDs as ideal components for evolving smart storage solutions tailored for machine learning. To cater towards this, in this work, we propose Salient Store a mini computational storage server (we call it edge storage server ) stack for managing the data archival in edge servers. Salient Store provides adaptive data compression using neural codecs and further enhances the data security by providing an accelerated quantum safe data encryption policy, protecting these vulnerable edge storage servers against the store now decrypt later (National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), 2023) attacks. 3 Data Compression using Neural Codec In this section we go over the overall design and design choices for the neural codec design of Salient Store . We discuss the edge storage architecture followed by the choice of neural codec and their design. 3.1 Salient Store Storage Architecture: Salient Store edge storage architecture is crafted to optimize data-flow and computational effi- ciency in continuous learning edge servers. Salient Store employs a hybrid model , integrating Computational Storage Drives (CSDs) with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) (AMD, b) and classical storage drives. This design, depicted in Fig. 2, gives the programmable computational capa- 7 bilities of CSDs along with the cost-effectiveness and durability of the classical HDDs. It leverages the PCIe interface for efficient peer-to-peer communication , substantially reducing communication latency and energy requirements. This setup alleviates the host CPU from handling frequent data movement interruptions. A storage platform entirely designed with CSDs is not pragmatic at the current time because of their exorbitant cost and power consumption (AMD, b; Cao et al., 2020) . However, a combination of CSDs with classical storage medium provides the most optimal solution and hence motivates our design. Edge Server PCIe Root COmplex FPGA CSD CSD FPGA Accelerator Figure 2: High-level design of the Salient Store edge server - it consists of the accelerated video analytics compute along with computational storage and classical storage drives. Data-flow Reorganization in Salient Store : At the core of Salient Store s design is the data-aware reorganization of compute processes. Unlike conventional storage servers, Salient Store discerns between the data path and the resource path for system I O calls, translating these requests into CSD-specific functions. These functions leverage FPGA kernels for efficient data processing. As discussed earlier,Salient Store edge storage implements a video archival by using neural compression followed by a quantum safe encryption (refer Fig. 1). To maximize the compute reuse between the compute pipeline and the archival pipeline, Salient Store uses apart of the neural network of the inference engine to extract features, and then further performs the encoding using the FPGA in the CSD. Neural codecs present a new paradigm video compression technology, leveraging deep learning to surpass traditional codec efficiency (Ma et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017). Traditional neural codecs, while innovative, typically encode and decode video streams in a monolithic fashion, which often results in suboptimal utilization of computational resources and inflexibility (Ma et al., 2019). This inherent inefficiency stems from their design which does not allow incremental improvements in video quality and often leads to either over-utilization or under-utilization of bandwidth. To address these shortcomings, the advent of layered neural codecs marks a significant advancement (Dasari et al., 2022a). Layered neural codecs, by design, encode video into multiple, distinct layers of data, each enhancing the video quality incrementally. This allows for dynamic adaptation to network fluctuations and client-side computational capabilities, thereby optimizing the streaming experience. The capability to adjust the quality dynamically, by decoding additional layers as resources permit, ensures efficient bandwidth usage and enhances the overall Quality of Experience (QoE), making layered neural codecs a compelling choice for modern video streaming solutions. In an effort to optimize video compression beyond traditional and current neural codec capabilities, we introduce an enhanced layered neural codec that utilizes both intra-frame and inter-frame redundancies. Our approach extends the layered neural codecs by incorporating motion vectors as a latent space, akin to the macroblock techniques used in H.264, to maximize inter-frame compression efficiency. 8 Algorithm 1 Neural Encoding and Compression using the video data inference pipeline. 1: Input: Video frames sequence F {f1, f2, . . . , fn} 2: Output: Compressed frames C {c1, c2, . . . , cn} 3: Initialize MobileNet Model M 4: Initialize Autoencoder Decoder D 5: Initialize Motion Vector Extractor V 6: procedure EXTRACTFEATURES(frame) 7: features M(frame) Extract features using MobileNet 8: return features 9: end procedure 10: procedure COMPRESSFEATURES(features) 11: compressed D(features) Compress using autoencoder 12: return compressed 13: end procedure 14: procedure CALCULATEMOTIONVECTORS(framecurrent, frameprevious) 15: motion_vectors V (framecurrent, frameprevious) 16: return motion_vectors 17: end procedure 18: procedure STACKCOMPRESSION(current_compressed, motion_vectors) 19: return some compression algorithm using current_compressed and motion_vectors 20: end procedure 21: for i 1 to n do 22: featuresi EXTRACTFEATURES(fi) 23: ci COMPRESSFEATURES(featuresi) 24: if i 1 then 25: mi CALCULATEMOTIONVECTORS(fi, fi 1) 26: ci STACKCOMPRESSION(ci, mi) 27: end if 28: C[i] ci 29: end for By exploiting the temporal correlations between consecutive frames, our codec can significantly reduce the required bitrate while maintaining high video quality. The primary innovation lies in leveraging motion vectors to identify and encode only the changes between frames, rather than re-encoding entire frames. This technique, combined with the use of anchor frames similar to keyframes in traditional codecs allows the codec to understand and predict frame sequences more effectively, reducing redundancy and enhancing compression. Let Ft represent the frame at time t, and Ft 1 be the anchor frame. The motion vector field Mt between Ft and Ft 1 is computed to capture the displacement of pixels. Each frame Ft is divided into blocks Bt,i, where i indexes the block within the frame. The residual frame Rt for each frame is calculated as: Rt Ft predict(Ft 1, Mt) where predict( ) is a function that reconstructs Ft from Ft 1 using the motion vector field Mt. This prediction involves translating the blocks of Ft 1 according to Mt and serves as the predicted frame. The residual frame Rt, which contains only the differences not captured by the motion prediction, is then encoded using the layered neural network. Each layer of the neural network encodes progressively finer details of Rt. If Lk(Rt) represents the k-th layer s encoding of the residual frame, the overall encoding of the frame can be expressed as: Et K X k 1 Lk(Rt) where K is the total number of layers, and each Lk encodes different levels of detail or different regions of the frame, based on the motion information and the prediction error. Algorithm 1 shows the details of the layered neural codec. We implement this neural codec using the FPGA in the CSDs. FPGAs are ideal for this application due to their parallel processing capabilities and the ability to handle multiple data streams concurrently. 9 Algorithm 2 Training Auto-Encoder with Motion Vectors and Stacked Compression while freezing the inference model. 1: Input: Set of training video sequences V 2: Initialize: MobileNet M Weights frozen 3: Initialize: Autoencoder A Trainable 4: Initialize: Motion Vector Extractor V 5: procedure EXTRACTMOTIONVECTORS(framecurrent, frameprevious) 6: motion_vectors V (framecurrent, frameprevious) 7: return motion_vectors 8: end procedure 9: procedure FORWARDPASS(video) 10: previous_features null 11: previous_compressed null 12: for each frame frame in video do 13: features M(frame) Extract features using frozen MobileNet 14: compressed A.encode(features) Compress features 15: if previous_compressed null then 16: motion_vectors EXTRACTMOTIONVECTORS(frame, previous_frame) 17: stacked_input concatenate (compressed, previous_compressed, motion_vectors) 18: compressed A.reencode(stacked_input) Stacked compression 19: end if 20: reconstructed A.decode(compressed) Decompress to reconstruct 21: Calculate reconstruction loss between frame and reconstructed 22: previous_frame frame 23: previous_compressed compressed 24: previous_features features 25: end for 26: Backpropagate loss and update weights of A only 27: end procedure 28: while not converged do 29: for each video in V do FORWARDPASS(video) 30: end for 31: end while The implementation of layered codecs involve the following components.1. Motion Estimation: Utilize dedicated hardware blocks for calculating motion vectors between consecutive frames. This step can leverage FPGA s DSP slices for fast cross-correlation or block matching algorithms. 2. Prediction and Residual Calculation: Implement pipelined architectures for the predict( ) function and subsequent residual calculation to minimize latency. 3. Layered Encoding: Each layer of the neural codec can be implemented using parallel processing units in FPGA, allowing simultaneous processing of different frame parts or different quality layers. 4.Data Flow Management: Design efficient data paths to handle the high throughput of video data and intermediate results between the FPGA blocks, ensuring that bandwidth and memory access bottlenecks are minimized. By optimizing each component for FPGA execution and taking advantage of the hardware s ability to execute multiple operations in parallel, the proposed codec can achieve real-time performance even for high-resolution video streams. The use of FPGA not only accelerates the processing speed but also provides flexibility to adapt to various codec configurations. Training the Neural Codecs to Utilize Inference Pipeline: The enhancement of our layered neural codec involves a joint training regimen that integrates the model used in inferecne pipeline, specifically MobileNet, as a static feature extractor within the compression framework. This strategy capitalizes on the robust, pre-trained features of MobileNet, which are frozen during training to ensure their integrity and to leverage their proven capability in capturing essential visual features. The extraction of motion vectors between frames further enriches the feature space by incorporating temporal dynamics essential for effective compression. The codec s autoencoder component, which is trainable, is then tasked with compressing these enriched features. This setup not only streamlines the encoding process by utilizing high-quality 10 features but also significantly enhances compression efficiency by exploiting both intra-frame richness and inter-frame continuity. The training process is designed to optimize the autoencoder s ability to compress and decompress video sequences efficiently, without altering the pretrained feature extractor, thereby providing a stable, high-performance baseline for feature representation. The mathematical formulation for this training process is centered around minimizing the reconstruction loss, L PN t 1 Ft ËFt 2 2; where Ft is the original frame at time t, and ËFt is the reconstructed frame, obtained by decoding the compressed representation that was encoded using features extracted via MobileNet and refined by the motion vector-informed autoencoder. The backpropagation is applied only to the layers of the autoencoder, ensuring that the feature extractor s parameters remain intact. This approach not only preserves the integrity of the visual features derived from MobileNet but also tailors the compression mechanism to be highly adaptive to the content-specific characteristics captured by these features. 4 Optimizing Lattice-Based Cryptography Followed by the video compression, in this section, we discuss the quantum safe encryption technique. Among quantum safe encryption algorithms, Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) (Micciancio Regev, 2009; Ajtai, 1996), grounded in hard lattice problems, offers robust resistance against quantum attacks. This quantum resilience is vital for protecting large data-sets on machine learning storage servers, particularly from store now, decrypt later threats. Algorithm 3 Lattice-Based Encryption Process 1: procedure LATTICE_BASED_ENCRYPT(message, public_key) 2: PM ConvertToPolynomial(message) 3: (PA, PE) GenerateRandomPolynomials() 4: C1 PolynomialMultiply(PA, public_key) Utilizing HSPM 5: C2 PolynomialMultiply(PA, PM) Employing SDMM 6: return (C1, C2) 7: end procedure At the heart of LBC lies the Ring-Learning with Errors (R-LWE) algorithm, which translates plaintext messages into polynomial representations and intertwines them with random polynomials using complex multiplications and additions, as delineated in Algorithm 3. Note that, within the LBC algorithm, certain components, specifically polynomial multiplications, exhibit similarities to operations performed in CNNs. These similarities open up the possibility of reusing hardware designed for CNN operations to accelerate LBC computations. The most common algorithms used fod the said operations are High-Speed Schoolbook Polynomial Multiplication (HSPM) and Pipelined Systolic Dimension Modular Multiplier (SDMM), and we propose to accelrate the same using the FPGAs in the CSDs. The data locality due to the SSD and the high throughput due to the FPGA could facilitate swift polynomial processing and refined modular multiplications using DSP slices, thereby accelerating the encryption process. Designing HSPM Accelerator on CSD FPGA: The HSPM hardware is characterized by its fully parallelized design, incorporating 128 Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units for handling polynomials of degree n 256. Each MAC unit within the HSPM architecture is capable of conducting two parallel modular multiplications. This is achieved through the use of a single Digital Signal Processing (DSP) block that operates on signed data representation. Consequently, these units are referred to as Signed Double Modular Multiplication (SDMM) units. The HSPM accelerator s architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 3a, comprises three pipelined stages. These stages include the data loading phase, the modular polynomial multiplication via the SDMM unit, and the final accumulation registers. Data is input into the HSPM in a serial-to-parallel conversion process, while the outputs, after undergoing addition operations, are retrieved serially through an address signal. Central to the Ring-Learning with Errors (R-LWE) based Public Key Encryption (PKE) is the equation d a b c. In this context, the operand a can represent polynomials such as p, a, or c1 from Algorithm 1, while b corresponds to e1, r2, and c to e2, e3, c2. During the data loading phase, the 256 coefficients of polynomial b are input serially into a 6-bit shift register. Simultaneously, the first coefficient a0 of polynomial a is fed in parallel to all 128 SDMM units. Post-loading, each SDMM 11 6bit shift register SDMM SDMM 13bit register Control logic a b c b c d (a) HSPM micro-architecture. - t n - - MR logic - t n - - DSP Unit ai b0 b1 S MR logic d0 d1 (b) Pipeline SDMM Structure micro-architecture. Figure 3: Microarchitectural designs of HSPM and SDMM: Hardware modules for polynomial multiplication in LBC. unit commences the modular multiplication of each coefficient ai with the entirety of b s coefficients in parallel. This process repeats for all coefficients ai. The resultant outputs from each SDMM calculation are accumulated every cycle. The final polynomial product p is sequentially read out by the address signal addrab, combined with the coefficient of c, thereby producing the final output d as d a b c. This output is then transmitted serially over n clock cycles. Designing SDMM Hardware on CSD FPGA: The SDMM hardware is innovatively designed to perform two modular multiplications per DSP Slice. This is achieved through the implementation of signed Gaussian sampling (Liu et al., 2019), for the error-vector e1 and the secret-key r2. In this signed representation, the Gaussian distribution ranges from [0, ks) to [q ks, 0), where k takes integer values 1, 2, 3, . . ., and is symmetrically distributed around m 0. Consequently, there is no data in the range [0, q 1), allowing the maximum value of the 13-bit samples to be represented efficiently by a 6-bit signed number. The modular multiplication utilizing these signed numbers is formulated as follows: b a mod q q [(b a) mod q] (1) Here, the most significant bit (MSB) signed-bit dictates the subtraction of the result from the modulus q, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. A single DSP unit includes a multiplier, with the lowest 18 bits of the 12 DSP output representing the first product d0 and the highest 18 bits indicating the second product d1, corresponding to b0 and b1 respectively, as depicted in Fig. 3b. Following the multiplication, the two 18-bit products undergo separate modular reductions. A Modular Reduction (MR) circuitry based on approximation (Kundi et al., 2020). Our MR unit achieves consumes 82 less hardware compared to classical implementation. This process is constant time, requiring only a single subtraction of q. The MR hardware, highlighted in Fig. 3b, consists of a single shift block, a subtractor, and a adder, consuming much less hardware then the state-of-the-art (Fan et al., 2018). The MR, in conjunction with the multiplier, delivers the output within 2 clock cycles. The SDMM also offers a simpler controller design for multiplication and in-place product term reduction after vector-vector multiplications. Notably, the SDMM can be easily reconfigured to support any modulus. 5 Implementation and Evaluation To implement and evaluate Salient Store , we chose two different platforms 1) Using a server- grade system with two Xilinx-Samsung computational storage drive (AMD, b), and 2) Using amazon web services (AWS) F1 instances, which have AMD Alveo FPGA which can work as the compute capable of peer-to-peer communication and thereby enabling a computational storage platform. We use Vitis 2022.2 along with Xilinx Runtime Library (AMD Xilinx) for programming the FPGAs in both computational storage drives and the Alveo card. The configuration of the server with Xilinx CSD has a 12-core Xeon bronze CPU with 128GB memory, 2 3.84TB CSDs, and 2 2TB SSDs. Similarly, the AWS server has 24 cores, with 192GB memory, one Alveo FPGA and 2TB SSDs. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Kitti Vision nuScenes Chime Cityscapes Waymo Normalized Latency Compute Server CSD Alveo FPGA Figure 4: Latency analysis of Salient Store on the commercial Xilinx CSD on a workstation class machine (lower is better).

Compute server indicates a software only classical storage solution without CSDs. 5.1 Evaluation of Encoding, Scaling and Accuracy In evaluating the Salient Store storage system, particularly for continuous learning scenarios video analytics applications, we selected data-sets that are not only dense but also necessitate continuous learning due to their dynamic nature. Autonomous driving and urban mobility applications, generating over 400TB of data annually (Wright"; "premioinc"; Bhardwaj et al., 2022), predominantly comprise video and 3D point cloud data, making them ideal for our evaluation. The Cityscapes data-set (Cordts et al., 2015) is a comprehensive collection of urban street scenes from 50 different cities, providing a rich source of annotated video data for semantic urban scene understanding. This data-set is particularly suited for evaluating the performance of Salient Store in dense, urban environments. Another video data-set, the Waymo Open Data-set (Sun et al., 2020), is one of the largest and most diverse data-sets for autonomous driving. It offers high-resolution sensor data, including LIDAR and camera recordings, across a variety of urban and suburban landscapes. This data-set s volume and diversity make it an excellent benchmark for assessing Salient Store s capabilities in handling large-scale, real-world data. For 3D point cloud data, we selected the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite (Geiger et al., 2012), a fundamental data-set in autonomous driving research. It includes a variety of data types and tasks, providing a real-world urban driving context that is essential for testing Salient Store s performance in processing and managing 3D spatial data. Additionally, the nuScenes data-set (Caesar et al., 2020) by Aptiv, with its comprehensive sensor data and annotations covering diverse driving scenes, is instrumental in evaluating Salient Store s efficiency in multi-modal data processing typical in urban mobility scenarios. Beyond the vision- based data, we also incorporated the Chime Audio data-set (Foster et al., 2015) into our evaluation. This data-set, consisting of audio recordings, offers a different modality to test the versatility of Salient Store in handling various types of continuous learning data beyond visual inputs. In our comparative analysis, we employ VSS: A Video Storage System (Haynes et al., 2021) as a baseline , given its innovative approach in optimizing video data management. VSS excels in decoupling high-level video operations from storage and retrieval processes, efficiently organizing data on disk, enhancing caching mechanisms, and reducing redundancies in multi-camera setups (Haynes et al., 2021). This system has demonstrated significant improvements in VDBMS read performance, up to 54 , and a reduction in storage costs by up to 45 (Haynes et al., 2021). VSS s emphasis on video data optimization makes it a pertinent benchmark for assessing the Salient Store storage system s capabilities in managing large-scale machine learning data-sets. We first implemented Salient Store on a workstation-class machine with two Xilinx CSDs - which colosely mimics the classical edge server setup. Fig. 4 shows the latency while using the storage server and CSD for performing data writes, normalized to the latency of doing the same using the state of the art Alveo FPGAs. Salient Store on CSDs perform 1.99 better than the implementation on classical storage systems. To further mimic realwold scenarios of multiple cameras sending multiple streams with various stream rate, we distributed video data into across two CSDs in different ratio, as shown in TABLE 2. Trivially, a load-balanced scenario outperforms any of the biased data distribution scenario. However, it is evident that any compute offloaded to any of the CSDs in these scenarios offers benefits in terms of data processing latency. To underscore the impact of Salient Store at a much larger scale, where one can assume a consolidated edge server catering towards multiple streams as depicted in Ekya (Bhardwaj et al., 2022), we utilized an AWS EC2 F1 instance with Alveo FPGAs, along with EC2 P4 instance with A100 GPUs to implement the continuous learning end-to-end. As shown in Fig. 5a Salient Store 14 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Kitti Vision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Normalized Latecy Compute Server VSS Storage Server Figure 6: Impact of scaling to multiple storage nodes. keeps up with the accuracy of the traditional compression system thanks to the robust layered coding algorithm. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5b, Salient Store has 4.49 less latency than VSS where as it shows about a 6.18 speedup compared to the classical storage server. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 5c, SLAT reduces the data communication volume up to 5.63 compared to the classical approaches, thereby saving bandwidth (reduces bandwidth by 36 , public cloud has strict regulations on measuring the actual bandwidth, and hence we report the approximate result from the traffic pattern) and energy. 0 1 2 3 4 5 Kitti Vision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Norm. Encryption Latency RSA Software RSA FPGA Lattice Software Figure 7: Proposed encryption vs the state-of-the-art normalized to the FPGA implementation of the lattice based encryption. Since majority of the storage systems are not limited to one storage server, but are spread across multiple servers, we scaled Salient Store by deploying it in a distributed fashion. We used 5 AWS EC2 F1 instances with Alveo FPGAs as storage nodes, along with one EC2 P4 instance with A100 GPUs as the compute server. We do not observe much change in the data volume. However, due to complex interaction between multiple storage nodes, especially where some of the data needed to arrive at different nodes via network, in Fig. 6, we observe a significant change in the latency compared to a single storage node. Although, a multi-node setup provides more parallelism, the speedup is sub-linear, and we observe 3 and 4.77 speedup against VSS and a classical storage server, respectively. 5.2 Evaluation of Video Data Recovery and Quality: To ensure proper video quality upon recovery, we perform a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) study of Salient Store with the classical encoding mechanisms H264 (ITU-T, 2019a) and H265 (HEVC) (ITU-T, 2019b). Experiments on waymo (Sun et al., 2020) dataset shows the PSNR of Salient Store compared to the classical H264 and HEVC encoding pipeline in Fig. 8. While 15 Salient Store is consistently performing better than H264, HEVC thanks to it s novel approach of fine grained computation at times outperforms our approach. A similar trend is observed in other datasets. With complex and high dimensional video data, HEVC computation complexity increases exponentially, and is more pronounced because of lack of hardware support. However, it is noteworthy that at higher bitrates, Salient Store consistently achieves high quality recovery with PSNR reaching 47dB. Furthermore, as we can see in Fig. 9, HEVC takes significantly more latency compared to Salient Store and therefore not entirely suitable for high frame-rate applications with resource constraints. 30 35 40 45 50 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 PSNR (dB) Bits per Pixel H264 H265 Salient Store Figure 8: Compression and Recovery efficiency. 0 10 20 30 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 Encoding Latency (s) Number of Layers H264 HEVC Salient Store Figure 9: Encoding Latency using layered coding. 5.3 Evaluation of Lattice Based Encryption One of the major contribution of Salient Store is accelerating the lattice-based encryption with the help of FPGAs on the storage nodes. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of our FPGA-accelerated lattice-based encryption against other state-of-the-art-techniques. RSA, the most popular encryption algorithm, when implemented using FPGA, outperforms our proposed hardware solution. However, our proposed solution offers 3.2 speedup compared to its software counterpart and a 2.5 speedup compared to the software based RSA algorithm. While we do agree that the lattice-based encryption has more overheads compared to the RSA algorithm, the benefit of being quantum-safe outweighs the minimal cost incurred on encryption. Fig. 10 shows the impact of scaling Salient Store with respect to a single node system, i.e., a single storage server. As the number of storage servers increases, the network contention and data orchestration challenges exponentially increase. Furthermore, each server performs more remote accesses, increasing the contention even more. This leads to an exponential growth in latency with the increase in the number of storage servers used per application. It is recommended to contain most of the data belonging to the same application in the same storage server to minimize remove disk accesses over network. 16 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 KittiVision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Relative Latecny 2 Nodes 3 Nodes 4 Nodes 5 Nodes 6 Nodes Figure 10: Change of data movement latency with respect to the number of storage servers. 0 2 4 6 8 Kitti Vision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Relative Latency 2 to 1 4 to 1 6 to 1 Figure 11: Impact of increasing the number of CSDs in the system (the baseline system has a SSD-to-CSD ratio 8 to 1). Similarly, Fig. 11 shows the impact of increasing the number of CSDs in a storage server. With increasing the number of CSDs per SSD (or other storage element) does show significant improvement because of increase in parallelism. However, a typical CSD is 15 expensive than a standard SSD and 25 expensive than a classical HDD. Integrating more number of CSDs into the standard storage server will significantly increase the cost of the server. Moreover, in large-scale systems where failure is common, replacing failed CSDs would further increase the cost. From our evaluation, we found an 8:1 ratio of SSD to CSD (capacity ratio) provides the best possible cost-to-acceleration benefit. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we have explored the critical role of storage systems in the context of continuous learning video analytics edge server, emphasizing in particular the transformative potential of Computational Storage Devices (CSDs) in this domain. Our proposal, Salient Store , highlights the need for a paradigm shift in storage architecture to accommodate the dynamic and computationally intensive nature of modern ML applications. By reducing unnecessary data movement and enabling near-data processing, CSDs enhance the efficiency, performance, and sustainability of storage servers. Salient Store , with its intelligent data orchestration and acceleration, can provide up to 6.18 latency and 6.13 data movement reduction, compared to classical systems. This is particularly evident in continuous learning scenarios prevalent in applications such as autonomous driving and urban mobility, where the volume and complexity of data are immense. Looking ahead, the role of storage systems is poised to become even more pivotal as ML applications continue to evolve and generate larger, more complex datasets. The ongoing innovation in the design and optimization of CSDs will be crucial in meeting these challenges. In summary, our research presents a comprehensive vision for the future of storage systems in ML, where computational storage 17 devices play a key role in advancing the, performance, efficiency, and capabilities of storage servers, thereby contributing significantly to the broader field of ML.

Unlike their compute architecture, storage and archival system for these edge servers has often been under-emphasized. This is unfortunate as they contribute significantly to the data management and data movement, especially in a emerging complute landscape where date storage and data protection has be- come one of the key concerns. To mitigate this, we propose Salient Store that specifically focuses on the integration of Computational Storage Devices (CSDs) into edge servers to enhance data processing and management, particularly in continuous learning scenarios, prevalent in fields such as autonomous driving and urban mobility. Our research, gos beyond the compute domain, and identifies the gaps in current storage system designs. We proposes a framework that aligns more closely with the growing data demands. We present a detailed analysis of data movement challenges within the archival workflows and demonstrate how the strategic integration of CSDs can significantly optimize data compression, encryption, as well as other data management tasks, to improve overall system performance. By leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs and the high internal bandwidth of SSDs, Salient Store reduces the communication latency and data volume by 6.2 and 6.1 , respectively.

While some of these applications rely on collecting the video data and processing them offline, many need real-time analytics for the seamless integration, operation and effectiveness of the task at hand (Bramberger et al., 2004; Apostolo et al., 2022; Grulich Nawab, 2018). Moreover, depending on the deployment, scenario and requirements, some of these applications also demand learning to keep up with the data drift (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Rebuffi et al., 2017). However, regulations, resource limitations and privacy concerns often mandate these applications (both learning and inference) to be performed at the edge (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024). For example, many of the European cities restrict the traffic video data to be streamed to the cloud (www.dlapiperdataprotection.com; Achieving Compliant Data Residency and Security with Azure; Bhardwaj et al., 2022), which enforces performing video Preprint.

The Shown storage pipeline is the preliminary focus of Salient Store . analytics and learning tasks related to urban mobility at the edge. This has lead to a significant development in the direction of enabling video analytics and learning with edge servers. Although efficient algorithms, compute orchestration and hardware have addressed the analytics part, the scaling of such a system becomes a problem primarily due to high energy consumption. Recent works try to solve this problem by augmenting these continuous learning edge servers with application-specific hardware targeted for intermittent computing which could run using solar power. However, all these works focus on the analytics part while overlooking one critical aspect: what happens to all those video data after the analytics? Data Archival: The answer is straightforward, especially for mission-critical public records like urban mobility and surveillance data: these need to be archived in a local storage to avoid under- mining the benefits of edge computation, i.e. minimizing communication and preserving privacy. However, managing such data requires substantial storage infrastructure. For instance, storing a full day s worth of 1080p video at 60fps requires (1920 1080 3 pixels 4 bytes per pixel 60 frames per second 3600 24)117.32 TiB of raw video data, which compresses to approximately 60 GiB to 400 GiB of encoded data per day. Including redundancy, this requires an additional 33 to 100 more storage capacity. Furthermore, given the plug-and-play nature of storage media like HDDs and SSDs, securing this data becomes even more critical. The typical archival process involves three key phases: compression, encryption, and redundancy. Fig.\n\n--- Segment 4 ---\nThe typical archival process involves three key phases: compression, encryption, and redundancy. Fig. 1 illustrates the data flow in an edge server, where video data are first encoded (using H264 or similar codecs), then encrypted (with RSA or similar standards), and finally stored across a distributed set of disks to ensure redundancy (e.g., RAID 5). These processes create a complex data-flow pipeline, differentiating two streams of video data: one for real-time inference and training, and another for archival. This dual-stream processing consumes considerable system resources such as CPU, memory, and energy, further complicating the management for intermittently powered systems like Us.Ã¡s (Mishra et al., 2024) where data integrity and security must be maintained during power disruptions 1. Table 1 provides an estimation of resource utilization on commercial systems underscoring the fact that compressing, encrypting and reliably storing the data, especially for (intermittent) edge servers is a bigger challenge in contrast to classical cloud storage servers. The Challenges: In edge computing architectures, the lack of data reuse between the analytics and video data archival poses significant challenges. Classically, video data is streamed simultaneously to compute and storage systems for various processing tasks, such as inference, exemplar selection, and storage, thereby increasing I O bandwidth and system processing demands. This processing complexity necessitates substantial compute and memory resources, escalating power consumption 1Management and retrieval of data typically utilize a vector database like file-system, although this is beyond the scope of this discussion. 2 Data Task Algorithm CPU Utilization DRAM Utilization 16 Core Xeon Peak Average All Encryptions RSA512 2.18 14.56 5.85 All Decryptions RSA512 3.45 17.2 6.12 3D PC Compression OctTree 26.78 78.2 32.54 Inflation OctTree 29.24 81.56 36.18 Video Compression ZStd 24.7 62.54 24.5 Inflation ZStd 22.6 79.18 29.43 Compression H264 12.85 52.46 21.4 Inflation H264 14.2 69.46 26.18 All (un)RAID Unraid 11.25 29.4 19.24 Table 1: Resource utilization while running different algorithms under classical data archival pipeline for multiple data modalities in an AWS h1.4xlarge storage-optimized instance.\n\n--- Segment 5 ---\nThis processing complexity necessitates substantial compute and memory resources, escalating power consumption 1Management and retrieval of data typically utilize a vector database like file-system, although this is beyond the scope of this discussion. 2 Data Task Algorithm CPU Utilization DRAM Utilization 16 Core Xeon Peak Average All Encryptions RSA512 2.18 14.56 5.85 All Decryptions RSA512 3.45 17.2 6.12 3D PC Compression OctTree 26.78 78.2 32.54 Inflation OctTree 29.24 81.56 36.18 Video Compression ZStd 24.7 62.54 24.5 Inflation ZStd 22.6 79.18 29.43 Compression H264 12.85 52.46 21.4 Inflation H264 14.2 69.46 26.18 All (un)RAID Unraid 11.25 29.4 19.24 Table 1: Resource utilization while running different algorithms under classical data archival pipeline for multiple data modalities in an AWS h1.4xlarge storage-optimized instance. (e.g., systems with CPUs having a thermal design power of 145W and 64GB of DRAM as noted in Table 1) and requiring larger form factors, which exceed the capabilities of intermittent systems and challenge sustainability goals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to minimize compute and power requirements in archival processes. Moreover, the divergence of analytics and archival pipelines from the outset suggests that optimizing both hardware, software and data-flow used in inference, learning and archival could significantly enhance throughput and energy efficiency. This can be achieved by using modern neural compression algorithms instead of the classical encoding algorithm. However, the neural compression algorithm needs to be compute efficient (reusing maximum analytics pipeline), have high compression ratio (need to compete with H264) and feature rich (could be decompressed and retrieved with a reasonable loss). Furthermore, it needs to take advantage of the data similarity between frames to further minimize the storage footprint, and thereby reducing the form factor and need of frequent disk swapping maintenance. The second challenge comes from privacy and security of sensitive data. Considering the cheap commodity use storage devices are often plug and play, they are often vulnerable for data leak, especially if they are deployed in public, like urban mobility setting. Unlike secure data centers, these federated, distributed and public deployment could be susceptible to direct physical attacks for data breach.\n\n--- Segment 6 ---\nConsidering the cheap commodity use storage devices are often plug and play, they are often vulnerable for data leak, especially if they are deployed in public, like urban mobility setting. Unlike secure data centers, these federated, distributed and public deployment could be susceptible to direct physical attacks for data breach. Although modern encryption algorithms like RSA are secure, there is still a threat of store now decrypt later2 kind of attack (National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), 2023). To mitigate this, quantum safe encryption algorithms needs to be used without hindering the throughput. Furthermore, the design needs to be programmable to ensure encryption keys to be changed regularly for additional security. Solution Space and Our Work: This paper proposes Salient Store , a novel storage solution designed for continuous learning edge servers by incorporating a hardware-software co-design framework that allows for efficient data archival and storage. Salient Store utilizes the state-of- the-art neural compression which partially uses the inference exemplar selection pipeline along with layered neural codecs to compress the video data. It also uses the motion vectors as a latent space to effectively use the inter-frame similarity, thereby further increasing the compression ratio. Salient Store also provides a hardware accelerated lattice-based quantum safe encryption mechanism. To tightly integrate these solutions to the storage space, while providing data security, Salient Store uses computational storage devices (CSDs) (AMD, b) which reduce the energy consumption while keeping the compute pipeline unaltered. Our main contributions include: We propose design of a hybrid storage pipeline equipped with computational storage drives (CSDs) where the different drives could communicate with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion. These CSDs synergistically orchestrate the archival related tasks between the storage controller CPU and the computational storage FPGAs. The hybrid storage system is capable of taking the computed 2Given a powerful enough computer like quantum computers, RSA encrypted data can be decrypted, and therefore National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) called for proposals to develop post quantum cryptography algorithms (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2024), and defined a standard for the same.

We discuss the storage data-flow, the compute orchestration and mapping in the proposed system. This includes a hardware software co-design for compute-intensive applications along with map- ping different functions to different hardware in the data pipeline. Furthermore, we add failure management support for the intermittent edge servers. We go beyond the compute and look into future-proofing the storage server by equipping it with quantum safe lattice-based encryption technique. We maximize the hardware utilization by reusing compute kernels from the compression pipeline. We detail the design of the hardware accelerated encryption and maximize the resource reuse between the exemplar selection and encryption. Finally we perform an in-depth exploration of this integration, supported by real-world data from domains such as autonomous driving and urban mobility, to illustrate its effectiveness in continuous learning scenarios. The proposed design provides 2.2 latency and 5.6 data movement benefits compared to the state-of-the-art, on a single storage and 4.8 latency benefit in a multi-node system. 2 Background and Motivation 2.1 Storage for Continuous Learning Edge Servers Recent developments in continuous learning for video analytics (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024) has significantly boosted the capabilities and accuracy of learning systems. The major focus of these works have been building compute platforms with efficient scheduling (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2024), and reconfigurable hardware design (Kim et al., 2024; Mishra et al., 2024). This solves majority of the bottlenecks in a performance-driven classical cloud server platform. However, video analytics for many applications (Corporation; Custom On-Device ML Models with Learn2Compress; Wright"; "premioinc") are moving towards the edge. Therefore, managing and storing the hefty volume of video data brings more challenge due to the energy, compute and form-factor limitations.\n\n--- Segment 8 ---\nHowever, video analytics for many applications (Corporation; Custom On-Device ML Models with Learn2Compress; Wright"; "premioinc") are moving towards the edge. Therefore, managing and storing the hefty volume of video data brings more challenge due to the energy, compute and form-factor limitations. Modern and upcoming applications like urban mobility and autonomous driving are predicted to be generating hundreds of exabytes of data (Urban Traffic Dataset; Corporation; Wright"; "premioinc") per year while increasingly being deployed at the edge calling for a robust, secure, and efficient infrastructure for storing data at the edge while needing occasional human intervention for maintenance. Using State-of-the-Art Video Data Storage? Maybe Not: While storing video data as files works for small systems, in very large-scale systems they are typically stored using vector databases (Shen et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2024). Vector databases typically extract features from the video data to form index and those indices are then sorted using various metrics like neighborhood, maximum similarity, etc. (Fonseca Jorge, 2003; Cao et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2023; Douze et al., 2024) for faster retrieval. The vector index are used to point to the meta-data of the video file and then the actual video data is retrieved from the storage (Shen et al., 2005). This approach helps context-based search like looking for particular objects, events, or attributes (Douze et al., 2024). However, it is obvious that this approach, albeit good for streaming and retrieval, are not entirely space-efficient, and at times can increase the data volume by many folds (Douze et al., 2024). In an edge server where we are only worried about storage and not retrieval3, the vector database approach is not effective. Rather, storing the data in a compressed and encrypted format (with redundancies) is more efficient and therefore is the focus of our work. Why Not the Usual Process? Now that we know Classical approach of video data storage involves encoding and encrypting the video data before storing them in a redundant storage array (Huang Xu, 2014; Fan et al., 2022; Korkiakangas, 2014; Yue et al., 2016) which consumes significant resources (refer Table 1).\n\n--- Segment 9 ---\nWhy Not the Usual Process? Now that we know Classical approach of video data storage involves encoding and encrypting the video data before storing them in a redundant storage array (Huang Xu, 2014; Fan et al., 2022; Korkiakangas, 2014; Yue et al., 2016) which consumes significant resources (refer Table 1). Even though there have been significant research in accelerating both compression (Collet Kucherawy, 2018; Chen et al., 2021) and encryption (Milanov, 2009; Rawat et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015), operating on large-scale video data often demands more resource than what edge servers could afford (Mishra et al., 2024). Co-locating this compute along with the inference and training would definitely hinder the critical path. 3We assume the data to be eventually available in the data repository, where they can be properly stored for efficient lookup. This can be done by periodically transporting the data by swapping out storage bays. Our goal is to maximize storage at edge so that the frequency of maintenance decreases. 4 The main reason these algorithms consume significant resources is because of the amount of data they handle. Every single 1920 1080 raw frame prior to encoding carries 23MiB of data which, 60fps, will require processing 1.4GiB of data per second per imaging source. This pipeline assumes the use of classical data encoding algorithms like H2644 which requires all the frames to encode a video stream, albeit it only saves the essential information. Therefore, it does not use any of the computations that are used in the inference and learning pipeline. Then, the question is: is there a way we can reuse the computations used for the inference to help us in encoding the data? The answer is neural codecs (Ma et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017). Neural Codecs DNNs for Compression: Neural codecs represent a paradigm shift in video com- pression technology, leveraging the capabilities of deep learning to optimize both encoding and decoding processes. Unlike traditional codecs that rely on predefined algorithms to compress video data, neural codecs utilize an end-to-end trainable system based on neural networks. These networks are trained on extensive video datasets, allowing them to dynamically adapt compression strategies based on the content s complexity and prevailing network conditions.\n\n--- Segment 10 ---\nUnlike traditional codecs that rely on predefined algorithms to compress video data, neural codecs utilize an end-to-end trainable system based on neural networks. These networks are trained on extensive video datasets, allowing them to dynamically adapt compression strategies based on the content s complexity and prevailing network conditions. The architectural backbone of neural codecs typically comprises an autoencoder, where the encoder compresses the video into a compact, lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs it back into video format. These blocks can be stacked over each other to form layered codecs (like SHVC and SVC). This process benefits significantly from residual learning techniques, where each successive layer in the network aims to correct errors from the previous layers, thereby enhancing the reconstructed video quality incrementally with each additional decoding layer. Moreover, neural codecs excel in adaptability, offering robust performance across variable bandwidth and computational conditions, making them particularly suited for real-time streaming environments. These codecs can operate on generic computational hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, without the need for specialized video processing units, thus broadening their applicability across different device platforms. This adaptability also extends to content delivery dynamics, where neural codecs can adjust the streaming quality in real-time, responding adeptly to fluctuations in network throughput and variations in device capabilities. Such capabilities not only enhance user experience by minimizing buffering and maximizing video quality but also optimize bandwidth usage, presenting a cost-effective solution for content providers. These technical advancements position neural codecs as potential game-changers in the video streaming industry (NVIDIA Corporation, 2024), promising significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in various streaming scenarios. One major issue with neural codecs are their lack of utilization of inter-frame similarity. Classically, neural codecs compress each frame by treating them like images. However, video data often comes with a large amount of inter-frame similarity (Ying et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2020, 2021; Ying et al., 2022a). This similarity could be exploited, like in classical encoding algorithms, to further increase the compression ratio while improving the feature quality. Furthermore, neural codecs offer us the flexibility to approximate the computation (using quantization) to further enhance efficiency.\n\n--- Segment 11 ---\nThis similarity could be exploited, like in classical encoding algorithms, to further increase the compression ratio while improving the feature quality. Furthermore, neural codecs offer us the flexibility to approximate the computation (using quantization) to further enhance efficiency. Since they also use the computation blocks of the standard neural network, they can be jointly trained along with the classifier network to perform as the feature extraction and encoding backbone, thereby maximizing the utilization of the inference pipeline, and reducing the computation needed for compression. This maximizes data and resource reuse, and the pipeline for inference and compression do not diverge from the get going. However, even with data reuse, performing compression using neural codecs would require extra compute resources, energy and latency, hindering the critical path, i.e., inference. However, this issue could be alleviated by not using the compute resource in the critical path and preferably moving the compute to the storage where the data will eventually be stored. This is where the modern and upcoming computational storage devices (CSDs) come to rescue: bringing computation closer to data while providing with maximum energy efficiency and programmability (Newsroom; AMD, b). However, storage systems are not typically built to cater towards the ML applications, and now that compression becomes a ML application with the use of stacked neural codecs, building the right storage stack along with computational storage devices becomes an important problem. Evolution of Computational Storage: The advent of CSDs represents a paradigm shift, bringing computation closer to storage. These devices, by integrating CPUs or FPGAs into the storage 4We do not consider H265 here as currently in commercial systems H264 is the standard and typically enjoys hardware support. Moreover, H265 is an extension of H264 with additional features like coding tree units and intra-prediction directions which demand significantly more computation. 5 medium, facilitate computation at the storage level. Initial applications of CSDs were confined to tasks like encryption decryption, RAID, and compression. However, there has been a significant push towards enabling more complex workloads, including query processing on CSDs. Efforts to adapt CSDs for machine learning applications, albeit limited in scope to classical learning and data management, mark a crucial step forward. Yet, the expansion of these technologies to encompass large-scale storage stacks and the integration of CSDs into conventional storage systems, particularly for ML applications, remains a significant challenge and an open area of research.\n\n--- Segment 12 ---\nEfforts to adapt CSDs for machine learning applications, albeit limited in scope to classical learning and data management, mark a crucial step forward. Yet, the expansion of these technologies to encompass large-scale storage stacks and the integration of CSDs into conventional storage systems, particularly for ML applications, remains a significant challenge and an open area of research. Bridging the Gap in Storage System Design: There is a discernible gap in the design and concep- tualization of storage drives, systems and servers, especially in the context of ML applications. Historically, researchers have investigated these components individually, often focusing on high- performance computing, scientific computing, and database applications. However, the specific demands of ML applications on storage systems have largely been overlooked. storage stack archi- tects often abstract the computational processes, neglecting considerations such as data movement cost, compute cost, and power requirements. Conversely, architects of storage drives, including CSDs, tend to overlook the broader application requirements, such as data prioritization, potential offloading of computational tasks to storage, and application-specific data compression and encryption strategies. Our research aims to bridge this gap, focusing specifically on the exigencies of continuous learning applications. 2.2 The Problem: Understanding the Data Flow Challenges in Data Movement: In both consumer applications and high-performance computing (HPC) programs, the process of data collection followed by analytics is a critical operation (Cao et al., 2020; Mailthody et al., 2019; Chapman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023). The efficiency of data movement significantly influences the performance and energy consumption of large-scale systems (Park et al.). As earlier discussions highlighted, applications on edge servers need to store generated data on storage stacks. These data are can then be moved to a central facility where they can be further treated for efficient retrieval ans on demand streaming. Urban Mobility A Case Study in Continuous Learning: To thoroughly understand this data flow, let us examine urban mobility , a prevalent continuous learning task (Bhardwaj et al., 2022). This task dynamically adapts to changing traffic patterns and environmental conditions. In urban mobility, high-volume data streams from multiple sources, such as high-resolution traffic cameras, are first compressed then analyzed for exemplar selection.\n\n--- Segment 13 ---\nThis task dynamically adapts to changing traffic patterns and environmental conditions. In urban mobility, high-volume data streams from multiple sources, such as high-resolution traffic cameras, are first compressed then analyzed for exemplar selection. This process involves representation learning (Rebuffi et al., 2017), where data is transformed into feature vectors using deep neural networks, followed by unsupervised learning techniques like k-means clustering. The goal is to identify unique or new classes of data for training while archiving known classes. In exemplar selection, the entire dataset is analyzed to detect classes with unique features, i.e., the images that are much different from the training data distribution or new classes that were not included in the training data. This is typically achieved through representation learning (Rebuffi et al., 2017) where the data is first converted into a feature vectors using the convolution layers of a large DNN model (or multiples of them), and then performing an unsupervised learning based classification, e.g., k-means (Arthur Vassilvitskii, 2007; Bahmani et al., 2012), to cluster the data. It is noteworthy that, the process of neural compression as well as inference representation learning use the feature extraction method. In this work, our goal is to use this to our advantage and maximize the compute and data reuse. The critical insight to be gleaned here is reusing data and compute pipeline prior to its transfer to storage could markedly diminish the costs associated with data movement. This approach would notably minimize the consumption of bandwidth and latency and curtail the compute requirements, thereby ensuring that the compute server s resources are judiciously employed only for indispensable computations. This strategic compute-reuse could help in optimizing the efficiency and efficacy of computational operations, especially in large scale data intensive and data driven applications. 2.3 Why Not More Compute at Storage Stacks? Integrating additional compute capabilities within storage stacks to offload certain computational tasks may seem an intuitive solution to the problem at hand. Theoretically, storage stacks could handle operations like unRAID and decryption, and extend their functionality to data inflation and 6 feature extraction. This would ostensibly allow for the selective transfer of only pertinent exemplar data to compute servers, thereby optimizing data movement costs. However, this approach presents several challenges.\n\n--- Segment 14 ---\nThis would ostensibly allow for the selective transfer of only pertinent exemplar data to compute servers, thereby optimizing data movement costs. However, this approach presents several challenges. Current storage stacks are outfitted with robust CPUs and memory systems, which are heavily tasked with state-of-the-art storage management algorithms, as evidenced by the resource utilization outlined in TABLE 1. These algorithms already consume substantial compute and memory resources, often to the extent of fully occupying the storage controller system, with a portion of resources being allocated for essential system stack operations. Furthermore, incorporating more advanced compute hardware, such as FPGAs, GPGPUs and other accelerators, would lead to underutilized I O slots and memory, consequently escalating the cost of storage systems. Additionally, storage solutions that are optimized for I O throughput tend to lose their specialized efficiency when repurposed for general compute tasks (Haynes et al., 2021). While the previous research has suggested the idea of integrating analytics into storage systems, these discussions usually revolve around system architecture, scheduling, and data management, without delving into the requisite compute capabilities (Haynes et al., 2021; Daum et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2019). 2.4 More Compute in Storage? Why Not? Exploring the realm of computational storage drives presents a tantalizing avenue for on-disk com- puting capabilities. Storage controllers, typically constrained by I O bandwidth, are now being complemented by the vast internal bandwidth of solid-state drives (SSDs), making them prime candi- dates for near-data processing. Recent advances in both commercial (Newsroom; AMD, b; Mesnier, 2022; ScaleFlux, a,b; Eideticom Laboratory; Laboratory) and academic sectors (Torabzadehkashi et al., 2019b; Barbalace Do, 2021; Lukken Trivedi, 2021; Torabzadehkashi et al., 2019a; Sala- mat et al., 2021, 2022; Do et al., 2013) advocate the use of computational storage drives (CSDs) across databases, high-performance computing (HPC), and analytics.

AMD and Xilinx have intro- duced specialized tools and libraries designed to harness CSDs (AMD, a; AMD Xilinx), enabling peer-to-peer PCIe transactions that bypass the CPU (AMD Xilinx). The emergence of Compute Express Link (CXL) technology (Sharma, 2022a,b; Jung, 2022) further amplifies the potential of disaggregated storage and memory systems. Decoupling compute tasks needed for storing the data from the host CPU and embedding them directly within storage devices, particularly through CSDs, has demonstrated significant performance and energy benefits. Tasks traditionally performed at the storage controller level are now being offloaded to CSDs, often accelerated using FPGA primitives (Kim et al., 2021; AMD Xilinx; AMD, a). Moreover, CSDs hold the potential to undertake critical machine learning tasks like feature extraction and clustering, streamlining tasks like neural compression. The unique combination of FPGAs parallel processing prowess, the substantial internal bandwidth of SSDs, and their block- accessible nature position CSDs as ideal components for evolving smart storage solutions tailored for machine learning. To cater towards this, in this work, we propose Salient Store a mini computational storage server (we call it edge storage server ) stack for managing the data archival in edge servers. Salient Store provides adaptive data compression using neural codecs and further enhances the data security by providing an accelerated quantum safe data encryption policy, protecting these vulnerable edge storage servers against the store now decrypt later (National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), 2023) attacks. 3 Data Compression using Neural Codec In this section we go over the overall design and design choices for the neural codec design of Salient Store .

We discuss the edge storage architecture followed by the choice of neural codec and their design. 3.1 Salient Store Storage Architecture: Salient Store edge storage architecture is crafted to optimize data-flow and computational effi- ciency in continuous learning edge servers. Salient Store employs a hybrid model , integrating Computational Storage Drives (CSDs) with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) (AMD, b) and classical storage drives. This design, depicted in Fig. 2, gives the programmable computational capa- 7 bilities of CSDs along with the cost-effectiveness and durability of the classical HDDs. It leverages the PCIe interface for efficient peer-to-peer communication , substantially reducing communication latency and energy requirements. This setup alleviates the host CPU from handling frequent data movement interruptions. A storage platform entirely designed with CSDs is not pragmatic at the current time because of their exorbitant cost and power consumption (AMD, b; Cao et al., 2020) . However, a combination of CSDs with classical storage medium provides the most optimal solution and hence motivates our design. Edge Server PCIe Root COmplex FPGA CSD CSD FPGA Accelerator Figure 2: High-level design of the Salient Store edge server - it consists of the accelerated video analytics compute along with computational storage and classical storage drives. Data-flow Reorganization in Salient Store : At the core of Salient Store s design is the data-aware reorganization of compute processes. Unlike conventional storage servers, Salient Store discerns between the data path and the resource path for system I O calls, translating these requests into CSD-specific functions. These functions leverage FPGA kernels for efficient data processing. As discussed earlier,Salient Store edge storage implements a video archival by using neural compression followed by a quantum safe encryption (refer Fig. 1). To maximize the compute reuse between the compute pipeline and the archival pipeline, Salient Store uses apart of the neural network of the inference engine to extract features, and then further performs the encoding using the FPGA in the CSD. Neural codecs present a new paradigm video compression technology, leveraging deep learning to surpass traditional codec efficiency (Ma et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017).\n\n--- Segment 17 ---\nTo maximize the compute reuse between the compute pipeline and the archival pipeline, Salient Store uses apart of the neural network of the inference engine to extract features, and then further performs the encoding using the FPGA in the CSD. Neural codecs present a new paradigm video compression technology, leveraging deep learning to surpass traditional codec efficiency (Ma et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017). Traditional neural codecs, while innovative, typically encode and decode video streams in a monolithic fashion, which often results in suboptimal utilization of computational resources and inflexibility (Ma et al., 2019). This inherent inefficiency stems from their design which does not allow incremental improvements in video quality and often leads to either over-utilization or under-utilization of bandwidth. To address these shortcomings, the advent of layered neural codecs marks a significant advancement (Dasari et al., 2022a). Layered neural codecs, by design, encode video into multiple, distinct layers of data, each enhancing the video quality incrementally. This allows for dynamic adaptation to network fluctuations and client-side computational capabilities, thereby optimizing the streaming experience. The capability to adjust the quality dynamically, by decoding additional layers as resources permit, ensures efficient bandwidth usage and enhances the overall Quality of Experience (QoE), making layered neural codecs a compelling choice for modern video streaming solutions. In an effort to optimize video compression beyond traditional and current neural codec capabilities, we introduce an enhanced layered neural codec that utilizes both intra-frame and inter-frame redundancies. Our approach extends the layered neural codecs by incorporating motion vectors as a latent space, akin to the macroblock techniques used in H.264, to maximize inter-frame compression efficiency. 8 Algorithm 1 Neural Encoding and Compression using the video data inference pipeline. 1: Input: Video frames sequence F {f1, f2, . . . , fn} 2: Output: Compressed frames C {c1, c2, . . .\n\n--- Segment 18 ---\n. . , cn} 3: Initialize MobileNet Model M 4: Initialize Autoencoder Decoder D 5: Initialize Motion Vector Extractor V 6: procedure EXTRACTFEATURES(frame) 7: features M(frame) Extract features using MobileNet 8: return features 9: end procedure 10: procedure COMPRESSFEATURES(features) 11: compressed D(features) Compress using autoencoder 12: return compressed 13: end procedure 14: procedure CALCULATEMOTIONVECTORS(framecurrent, frameprevious) 15: motion_vectors V (framecurrent, frameprevious) 16: return motion_vectors 17: end procedure 18: procedure STACKCOMPRESSION(current_compressed, motion_vectors) 19: return some compression algorithm using current_compressed and motion_vectors 20: end procedure 21: for i 1 to n do 22: featuresi EXTRACTFEATURES(fi) 23: ci COMPRESSFEATURES(featuresi) 24: if i 1 then 25: mi CALCULATEMOTIONVECTORS(fi, fi 1) 26: ci STACKCOMPRESSION(ci, mi) 27: end if 28: C[i] ci 29: end for By exploiting the temporal correlations between consecutive frames, our codec can significantly reduce the required bitrate while maintaining high video quality. The primary innovation lies in leveraging motion vectors to identify and encode only the changes between frames, rather than re-encoding entire frames. This technique, combined with the use of anchor frames similar to keyframes in traditional codecs allows the codec to understand and predict frame sequences more effectively, reducing redundancy and enhancing compression. Let Ft represent the frame at time t, and Ft 1 be the anchor frame. The motion vector field Mt between Ft and Ft 1 is computed to capture the displacement of pixels. Each frame Ft is divided into blocks Bt,i, where i indexes the block within the frame. The residual frame Rt for each frame is calculated as: Rt Ft predict(Ft 1, Mt) where predict( ) is a function that reconstructs Ft from Ft 1 using the motion vector field Mt. This prediction involves translating the blocks of Ft 1 according to Mt and serves as the predicted frame.\n\n--- Segment 19 ---\nThe residual frame Rt for each frame is calculated as: Rt Ft predict(Ft 1, Mt) where predict( ) is a function that reconstructs Ft from Ft 1 using the motion vector field Mt. This prediction involves translating the blocks of Ft 1 according to Mt and serves as the predicted frame. The residual frame Rt, which contains only the differences not captured by the motion prediction, is then encoded using the layered neural network. Each layer of the neural network encodes progressively finer details of Rt. If Lk(Rt) represents the k-th layer s encoding of the residual frame, the overall encoding of the frame can be expressed as: Et K X k 1 Lk(Rt) where K is the total number of layers, and each Lk encodes different levels of detail or different regions of the frame, based on the motion information and the prediction error. Algorithm 1 shows the details of the layered neural codec. We implement this neural codec using the FPGA in the CSDs. FPGAs are ideal for this application due to their parallel processing capabilities and the ability to handle multiple data streams concurrently. 9 Algorithm 2 Training Auto-Encoder with Motion Vectors and Stacked Compression while freezing the inference model.\n\n--- Segment 20 ---\nFPGAs are ideal for this application due to their parallel processing capabilities and the ability to handle multiple data streams concurrently. 9 Algorithm 2 Training Auto-Encoder with Motion Vectors and Stacked Compression while freezing the inference model. 1: Input: Set of training video sequences V 2: Initialize: MobileNet M Weights frozen 3: Initialize: Autoencoder A Trainable 4: Initialize: Motion Vector Extractor V 5: procedure EXTRACTMOTIONVECTORS(framecurrent, frameprevious) 6: motion_vectors V (framecurrent, frameprevious) 7: return motion_vectors 8: end procedure 9: procedure FORWARDPASS(video) 10: previous_features null 11: previous_compressed null 12: for each frame frame in video do 13: features M(frame) Extract features using frozen MobileNet 14: compressed A.encode(features) Compress features 15: if previous_compressed null then 16: motion_vectors EXTRACTMOTIONVECTORS(frame, previous_frame) 17: stacked_input concatenate (compressed, previous_compressed, motion_vectors) 18: compressed A.reencode(stacked_input) Stacked compression 19: end if 20: reconstructed A.decode(compressed) Decompress to reconstruct 21: Calculate reconstruction loss between frame and reconstructed 22: previous_frame frame 23: previous_compressed compressed 24: previous_features features 25: end for 26: Backpropagate loss and update weights of A only 27: end procedure 28: while not converged do 29: for each video in V do FORWARDPASS(video) 30: end for 31: end while The implementation of layered codecs involve the following components.1.

Prediction and Residual Calculation: Implement pipelined architectures for the predict( ) function and subsequent residual calculation to minimize latency. 3. Layered Encoding: Each layer of the neural codec can be implemented using parallel processing units in FPGA, allowing simultaneous processing of different frame parts or different quality layers.\n\n--- Segment 21 ---\n3. Layered Encoding: Each layer of the neural codec can be implemented using parallel processing units in FPGA, allowing simultaneous processing of different frame parts or different quality layers. 4.Data Flow Management: Design efficient data paths to handle the high throughput of video data and intermediate results between the FPGA blocks, ensuring that bandwidth and memory access bottlenecks are minimized. By optimizing each component for FPGA execution and taking advantage of the hardware s ability to execute multiple operations in parallel, the proposed codec can achieve real-time performance even for high-resolution video streams. The use of FPGA not only accelerates the processing speed but also provides flexibility to adapt to various codec configurations. Training the Neural Codecs to Utilize Inference Pipeline: The enhancement of our layered neural codec involves a joint training regimen that integrates the model used in inferecne pipeline, specifically MobileNet, as a static feature extractor within the compression framework. This strategy capitalizes on the robust, pre-trained features of MobileNet, which are frozen during training to ensure their integrity and to leverage their proven capability in capturing essential visual features. The extraction of motion vectors between frames further enriches the feature space by incorporating temporal dynamics essential for effective compression. The codec s autoencoder component, which is trainable, is then tasked with compressing these enriched features. This setup not only streamlines the encoding process by utilizing high-quality 10 features but also significantly enhances compression efficiency by exploiting both intra-frame richness and inter-frame continuity. The training process is designed to optimize the autoencoder s ability to compress and decompress video sequences efficiently, without altering the pretrained feature extractor, thereby providing a stable, high-performance baseline for feature representation. The mathematical formulation for this training process is centered around minimizing the reconstruction loss, L PN t 1 Ft ËFt 2 2; where Ft is the original frame at time t, and ËFt is the reconstructed frame, obtained by decoding the compressed representation that was encoded using features extracted via MobileNet and refined by the motion vector-informed autoencoder. The backpropagation is applied only to the layers of the autoencoder, ensuring that the feature extractor s parameters remain intact.\n\n--- Segment 22 ---\nThe mathematical formulation for this training process is centered around minimizing the reconstruction loss, L PN t 1 Ft ËFt 2 2; where Ft is the original frame at time t, and ËFt is the reconstructed frame, obtained by decoding the compressed representation that was encoded using features extracted via MobileNet and refined by the motion vector-informed autoencoder. The backpropagation is applied only to the layers of the autoencoder, ensuring that the feature extractor s parameters remain intact. This approach not only preserves the integrity of the visual features derived from MobileNet but also tailors the compression mechanism to be highly adaptive to the content-specific characteristics captured by these features. 4 Optimizing Lattice-Based Cryptography Followed by the video compression, in this section, we discuss the quantum safe encryption technique. Among quantum safe encryption algorithms, Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) (Micciancio Regev, 2009; Ajtai, 1996), grounded in hard lattice problems, offers robust resistance against quantum attacks. This quantum resilience is vital for protecting large data-sets on machine learning storage servers, particularly from store now, decrypt later threats.

Note that, within the LBC algorithm, certain components, specifically polynomial multiplications, exhibit similarities to operations performed in CNNs. These similarities open up the possibility of reusing hardware designed for CNN operations to accelerate LBC computations.\n\n--- Segment 23 ---\nNote that, within the LBC algorithm, certain components, specifically polynomial multiplications, exhibit similarities to operations performed in CNNs. These similarities open up the possibility of reusing hardware designed for CNN operations to accelerate LBC computations. The most common algorithms used fod the said operations are High-Speed Schoolbook Polynomial Multiplication (HSPM) and Pipelined Systolic Dimension Modular Multiplier (SDMM), and we propose to accelrate the same using the FPGAs in the CSDs. The data locality due to the SSD and the high throughput due to the FPGA could facilitate swift polynomial processing and refined modular multiplications using DSP slices, thereby accelerating the encryption process. Designing HSPM Accelerator on CSD FPGA: The HSPM hardware is characterized by its fully parallelized design, incorporating 128 Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units for handling polynomials of degree n 256. Each MAC unit within the HSPM architecture is capable of conducting two parallel modular multiplications. This is achieved through the use of a single Digital Signal Processing (DSP) block that operates on signed data representation. Consequently, these units are referred to as Signed Double Modular Multiplication (SDMM) units. The HSPM accelerator s architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 3a, comprises three pipelined stages. These stages include the data loading phase, the modular polynomial multiplication via the SDMM unit, and the final accumulation registers. Data is input into the HSPM in a serial-to-parallel conversion process, while the outputs, after undergoing addition operations, are retrieved serially through an address signal. Central to the Ring-Learning with Errors (R-LWE) based Public Key Encryption (PKE) is the equation d a b c. In this context, the operand a can represent polynomials such as p, a, or c1 from Algorithm 1, while b corresponds to e1, r2, and c to e2, e3, c2.

This process repeats for all coefficients ai. The resultant outputs from each SDMM calculation are accumulated every cycle. The final polynomial product p is sequentially read out by the address signal addrab, combined with the coefficient of c, thereby producing the final output d as d a b c. This output is then transmitted serially over n clock cycles. Designing SDMM Hardware on CSD FPGA: The SDMM hardware is innovatively designed to perform two modular multiplications per DSP Slice. This is achieved through the implementation of signed Gaussian sampling (Liu et al., 2019), for the error-vector e1 and the secret-key r2. In this signed representation, the Gaussian distribution ranges from [0, ks) to [q ks, 0), where k takes integer values 1, 2, 3, . . ., and is symmetrically distributed around m 0. Consequently, there is no data in the range [0, q 1), allowing the maximum value of the 13-bit samples to be represented efficiently by a 6-bit signed number. The modular multiplication utilizing these signed numbers is formulated as follows: b a mod q q [(b a) mod q] (1) Here, the most significant bit (MSB) signed-bit dictates the subtraction of the result from the modulus q, as illustrated in Fig. 3b.\n\n--- Segment 25 ---\nThe modular multiplication utilizing these signed numbers is formulated as follows: b a mod q q [(b a) mod q] (1) Here, the most significant bit (MSB) signed-bit dictates the subtraction of the result from the modulus q, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. A single DSP unit includes a multiplier, with the lowest 18 bits of the 12 DSP output representing the first product d0 and the highest 18 bits indicating the second product d1, corresponding to b0 and b1 respectively, as depicted in Fig. 3b. Following the multiplication, the two 18-bit products undergo separate modular reductions. A Modular Reduction (MR) circuitry based on approximation (Kundi et al., 2020). Our MR unit achieves consumes 82 less hardware compared to classical implementation. This process is constant time, requiring only a single subtraction of q. The MR hardware, highlighted in Fig. 3b, consists of a single shift block, a subtractor, and a adder, consuming much less hardware then the state-of-the-art (Fan et al., 2018). The MR, in conjunction with the multiplier, delivers the output within 2 clock cycles. The SDMM also offers a simpler controller design for multiplication and in-place product term reduction after vector-vector multiplications. Notably, the SDMM can be easily reconfigured to support any modulus. 5 Implementation and Evaluation To implement and evaluate Salient Store , we chose two different platforms 1) Using a server- grade system with two Xilinx-Samsung computational storage drive (AMD, b), and 2) Using amazon web services (AWS) F1 instances, which have AMD Alveo FPGA which can work as the compute capable of peer-to-peer communication and thereby enabling a computational storage platform. We use Vitis 2022.2 along with Xilinx Runtime Library (AMD Xilinx) for programming the FPGAs in both computational storage drives and the Alveo card. The configuration of the server with Xilinx CSD has a 12-core Xeon bronze CPU with 128GB memory, 2 3.84TB CSDs, and 2 2TB SSDs. Similarly, the AWS server has 24 cores, with 192GB memory, one Alveo FPGA and 2TB SSDs.\n\n--- Segment 26 ---\nThe configuration of the server with Xilinx CSD has a 12-core Xeon bronze CPU with 128GB memory, 2 3.84TB CSDs, and 2 2TB SSDs.

Compute server indicates a software only classical storage solution without CSDs. 5.1 Evaluation of Encoding, Scaling and Accuracy In evaluating the Salient Store storage system, particularly for continuous learning scenarios video analytics applications, we selected data-sets that are not only dense but also necessitate continuous learning due to their dynamic nature. Autonomous driving and urban mobility applications, generating over 400TB of data annually (Wright"; "premioinc"; Bhardwaj et al., 2022), predominantly comprise video and 3D point cloud data, making them ideal for our evaluation. The Cityscapes data-set (Cordts et al., 2015) is a comprehensive collection of urban street scenes from 50 different cities, providing a rich source of annotated video data for semantic urban scene understanding. This data-set is particularly suited for evaluating the performance of Salient Store in dense, urban environments. Another video data-set, the Waymo Open Data-set (Sun et al., 2020), is one of the largest and most diverse data-sets for autonomous driving. It offers high-resolution sensor data, including LIDAR and camera recordings, across a variety of urban and suburban landscapes. This data-set s volume and diversity make it an excellent benchmark for assessing Salient Store s capabilities in handling large-scale, real-world data. For 3D point cloud data, we selected the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite (Geiger et al., 2012), a fundamental data-set in autonomous driving research. It includes a variety of data types and tasks, providing a real-world urban driving context that is essential for testing Salient Store s performance in processing and managing 3D spatial data. Additionally, the nuScenes data-set (Caesar et al., 2020) by Aptiv, with its comprehensive sensor data and annotations covering diverse driving scenes, is instrumental in evaluating Salient Store s efficiency in multi-modal data processing typical in urban mobility scenarios. Beyond the vision- based data, we also incorporated the Chime Audio data-set (Foster et al., 2015) into our evaluation. This data-set, consisting of audio recordings, offers a different modality to test the versatility of Salient Store in handling various types of continuous learning data beyond visual inputs.\n\n--- Segment 28 ---\nBeyond the vision- based data, we also incorporated the Chime Audio data-set (Foster et al., 2015) into our evaluation. This data-set, consisting of audio recordings, offers a different modality to test the versatility of Salient Store in handling various types of continuous learning data beyond visual inputs. In our comparative analysis, we employ VSS: A Video Storage System (Haynes et al., 2021) as a baseline , given its innovative approach in optimizing video data management. VSS excels in decoupling high-level video operations from storage and retrieval processes, efficiently organizing data on disk, enhancing caching mechanisms, and reducing redundancies in multi-camera setups (Haynes et al., 2021). This system has demonstrated significant improvements in VDBMS read performance, up to 54 , and a reduction in storage costs by up to 45 (Haynes et al., 2021). VSS s emphasis on video data optimization makes it a pertinent benchmark for assessing the Salient Store storage system s capabilities in managing large-scale machine learning data-sets. We first implemented Salient Store on a workstation-class machine with two Xilinx CSDs - which colosely mimics the classical edge server setup. Fig. 4 shows the latency while using the storage server and CSD for performing data writes, normalized to the latency of doing the same using the state of the art Alveo FPGAs. Salient Store on CSDs perform 1.99 better than the implementation on classical storage systems. To further mimic realwold scenarios of multiple cameras sending multiple streams with various stream rate, we distributed video data into across two CSDs in different ratio, as shown in TABLE 2. Trivially, a load-balanced scenario outperforms any of the biased data distribution scenario. However, it is evident that any compute offloaded to any of the CSDs in these scenarios offers benefits in terms of data processing latency. To underscore the impact of Salient Store at a much larger scale, where one can assume a consolidated edge server catering towards multiple streams as depicted in Ekya (Bhardwaj et al., 2022), we utilized an AWS EC2 F1 instance with Alveo FPGAs, along with EC2 P4 instance with A100 GPUs to implement the continuous learning end-to-end. As shown in Fig.\n\n--- Segment 29 ---\nTo underscore the impact of Salient Store at a much larger scale, where one can assume a consolidated edge server catering towards multiple streams as depicted in Ekya (Bhardwaj et al., 2022), we utilized an AWS EC2 F1 instance with Alveo FPGAs, along with EC2 P4 instance with A100 GPUs to implement the continuous learning end-to-end.

Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5b, Salient Store has 4.49 less latency than VSS where as it shows about a 6.18 speedup compared to the classical storage server. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 5c, SLAT reduces the data communication volume up to 5.63 compared to the classical approaches, thereby saving bandwidth (reduces bandwidth by 36 , public cloud has strict regulations on measuring the actual bandwidth, and hence we report the approximate result from the traffic pattern) and energy. 0 1 2 3 4 5 Kitti Vision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Norm. Encryption Latency RSA Software RSA FPGA Lattice Software Figure 7: Proposed encryption vs the state-of-the-art normalized to the FPGA implementation of the lattice based encryption. Since majority of the storage systems are not limited to one storage server, but are spread across multiple servers, we scaled Salient Store by deploying it in a distributed fashion. We used 5 AWS EC2 F1 instances with Alveo FPGAs as storage nodes, along with one EC2 P4 instance with A100 GPUs as the compute server. We do not observe much change in the data volume. However, due to complex interaction between multiple storage nodes, especially where some of the data needed to arrive at different nodes via network, in Fig. 6, we observe a significant change in the latency compared to a single storage node. Although, a multi-node setup provides more parallelism, the speedup is sub-linear, and we observe 3 and 4.77 speedup against VSS and a classical storage server, respectively.\n\n--- Segment 30 ---\n6, we observe a significant change in the latency compared to a single storage node. Although, a multi-node setup provides more parallelism, the speedup is sub-linear, and we observe 3 and 4.77 speedup against VSS and a classical storage server, respectively. 5.2 Evaluation of Video Data Recovery and Quality: To ensure proper video quality upon recovery, we perform a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) study of Salient Store with the classical encoding mechanisms H264 (ITU-T, 2019a) and H265 (HEVC) (ITU-T, 2019b). Experiments on waymo (Sun et al., 2020) dataset shows the PSNR of Salient Store compared to the classical H264 and HEVC encoding pipeline in Fig. 8. While 15 Salient Store is consistently performing better than H264, HEVC thanks to it s novel approach of fine grained computation at times outperforms our approach. A similar trend is observed in other datasets. With complex and high dimensional video data, HEVC computation complexity increases exponentially, and is more pronounced because of lack of hardware support. However, it is noteworthy that at higher bitrates, Salient Store consistently achieves high quality recovery with PSNR reaching 47dB. Furthermore, as we can see in Fig. 9, HEVC takes significantly more latency compared to Salient Store and therefore not entirely suitable for high frame-rate applications with resource constraints. 30 35 40 45 50 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 PSNR (dB) Bits per Pixel H264 H265 Salient Store Figure 8: Compression and Recovery efficiency. 0 10 20 30 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 Encoding Latency (s) Number of Layers H264 HEVC Salient Store Figure 9: Encoding Latency using layered coding. 5.3 Evaluation of Lattice Based Encryption One of the major contribution of Salient Store is accelerating the lattice-based encryption with the help of FPGAs on the storage nodes. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of our FPGA-accelerated lattice-based encryption against other state-of-the-art-techniques. RSA, the most popular encryption algorithm, when implemented using FPGA, outperforms our proposed hardware solution.\n\n--- Segment 31 ---\n7 shows the comparison of our FPGA-accelerated lattice-based encryption against other state-of-the-art-techniques. RSA, the most popular encryption algorithm, when implemented using FPGA, outperforms our proposed hardware solution. However, our proposed solution offers 3.2 speedup compared to its software counterpart and a 2.5 speedup compared to the software based RSA algorithm. While we do agree that the lattice-based encryption has more overheads compared to the RSA algorithm, the benefit of being quantum-safe outweighs the minimal cost incurred on encryption. Fig. 10 shows the impact of scaling Salient Store with respect to a single node system, i.e., a single storage server. As the number of storage servers increases, the network contention and data orchestration challenges exponentially increase. Furthermore, each server performs more remote accesses, increasing the contention even more. This leads to an exponential growth in latency with the increase in the number of storage servers used per application. It is recommended to contain most of the data belonging to the same application in the same storage server to minimize remove disk accesses over network. 16 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 KittiVision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Relative Latecny 2 Nodes 3 Nodes 4 Nodes 5 Nodes 6 Nodes Figure 10: Change of data movement latency with respect to the number of storage servers. 0 2 4 6 8 Kitti Vision nuScenes CHIME Cityscapes Waymo Relative Latency 2 to 1 4 to 1 6 to 1 Figure 11: Impact of increasing the number of CSDs in the system (the baseline system has a SSD-to-CSD ratio 8 to 1). Similarly, Fig. 11 shows the impact of increasing the number of CSDs in a storage server. With increasing the number of CSDs per SSD (or other storage element) does show significant improvement because of increase in parallelism. However, a typical CSD is 15 expensive than a standard SSD and 25 expensive than a classical HDD. Integrating more number of CSDs into the standard storage server will significantly increase the cost of the server. Moreover, in large-scale systems where failure is common, replacing failed CSDs would further increase the cost. From our evaluation, we found an 8:1 ratio of SSD to CSD (capacity ratio) provides the best possible cost-to-acceleration benefit.\n\n--- Segment 32 ---\nMoreover, in large-scale systems where failure is common, replacing failed CSDs would further increase the cost.

Our proposal, Salient Store , highlights the need for a paradigm shift in storage architecture to accommodate the dynamic and computationally intensive nature of modern ML applications. By reducing unnecessary data movement and enabling near-data processing, CSDs enhance the efficiency, performance, and sustainability of storage servers. Salient Store , with its intelligent data orchestration and acceleration, can provide up to 6.18 latency and 6.13 data movement reduction, compared to classical systems. This is particularly evident in continuous learning scenarios prevalent in applications such as autonomous driving and urban mobility, where the volume and complexity of data are immense. Looking ahead, the role of storage systems is poised to become even more pivotal as ML applications continue to evolve and generate larger, more complex datasets. The ongoing innovation in the design and optimization of CSDs will be crucial in meeting these challenges. In summary, our research presents a comprehensive vision for the future of storage systems in ML, where computational storage 17 devices play a key role in advancing the, performance, efficiency, and capabilities of storage servers, thereby contributing significantly to the broader field of ML.
