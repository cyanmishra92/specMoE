A bottleneck for the deployment of such neural networks is area utilization, which is directly related to the required constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) operations. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for implementing CMVM operations with distributed arithmetic (DA) on FPGAs that simultaneously optimizes for area consumption and latency.

While typical real-time inference applications have latency constraints of a few milliseconds [17, 28, 43], certain specific applications require sub-microsecond inference latency. For instance, at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [40], hundreds of terabytes of data are generated by the detectors every second from proton-proton collisions at a rate of 4 MHz. This enormous data throughput is reduced by a hardware system, 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟, which filters the data in real-time at the same rate. It determines which event should be kept for offline processing or discarded, and the final decision must be made within a few microseconds [38, 39].

Manuscript submitted to ACM Manuscript submitted to ACM 1 2 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu trigger s accuracy is vital to keep only the relevant events for physics studies, effectively managing the downstream data rate by reducing it by two orders of magnitude. O(1000) field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are currently used in the trigger system, where several algorithms run in parallel on each FPGA. As a result, resources are scarce, and the footprint of each algorithm must be minimal. In anticipation of the LHC s upgrade to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [45], Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being actively explored to enhance the current trigger system [1, 38, 39]. However, integrating demanding models under such strict resource and latency constraints remains challenging. To meet the latency requirements, the neural networks used in such applications are typically deployed on FPGAs fully unrolled and pipelined (usually with an initiation interval of one). hls4ml, a free and open-source library for synthesizing deployable firmware for running neural network inferences on FPGAs, is widely used for implementing such neural networks on FPGAs [1, 12 14, 36, 38, 39]. The library parses the architectures of the neural networks and generates the corresponding high-level synthesis (HLS) projects for FPGAs with a set of fixed templates for common neural network layers or operations. The generated HLS projects are then synthesized into hardware description language (HDL) code by the corresponding HLS backends. Frequently, the most resource-consuming part of the designs are the constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) operations in the neural networks, such as those in the dense or convolutional layers. As the final design is fully unrolled, the CMVM operations are typically implemented primarily with distributed arithmetic (DA) [27] by the HLS backends, as suggested by the high lookup-table (LUT) utilization with moderate to low digital signal processor (DSP) utilization in the synthesized designs. In this work, we present da4ml, a fast, scalable, and accurate optimization framework for CMVM targeting ultra- low-latency neural networks on FPGAs. Most existing exact multiplierless CMVM algorithms are either too slow (e.g., 𝐻𝑐𝑚𝑣𝑚: O(𝑁3)1 time [3], hours for moderate-size matrices), or miss significant opportunities for optimization (e.g., SCMVM: O(𝑁2) time [44], but cannot capture differently scaled subexpressions). The proposed da4ml combines a novel graph-based decomposition with cost-aware Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE), which retains full numerical precision (not approximate), captures subexpression reuse even across differently scaled terms and signed digits, and has a much better asymptotic complexity O(𝑁2) and a five-orders-of-magnitude faster runtime (Table 2). This makes it practical for realistic, large-scale networks in ultra-low-latency environments such as the CERN LHC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source, end-to-end DA-based neural network compiler with optimized CMVM operations. By tightly integrating our framework with hls4ml, it provides a drop-in complement for the default CMVM implementation in hls4ml. This tight integration into an established toolchain (the hls4ml workflow) lowers the barrier to adoption for the broader HEP and FPGA communities. The framework also supports direct RTL generation without going through HLS for fast prototyping and easier integration into existing RTL workflows. The practical impact of the proposed framework has been demonstrated by enabling the production deployment of the AXOL1TL [1] anomaly detection trigger at the CMS experiment, where it significantly improves the resource utilization and timing closure of the synthesized design. The contributions of this work are as follows: We propose da4ml, a novel, performant, and scalable CMVM optimization framework with a hybrid algorithm that combines graph-based decomposition with cost-aware CSE. It offers orders of magnitude faster runtime than the prior state of the art while achieving comparable resource efficiency. 1𝑁is the number of non-zero signed digits needed to represent the constant matrix. Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 3 We implement the proposed da4ml framework as an open-source library and tightly integrate it into the widely used hls4ml tool as a drop-in solution for FPGA-based ML designs. da4ml can also generate synthesizable RTL directly, allowing users to bypass HLS where needed. In addition, da4ml has enabled production deployment of the AXOL1TL [1] anomaly detection trigger at CMS with improved resource efficiency and timing closure. We evaluate the proposed framework on both synthetic CMVM benchmarks and realistic neural networks for the CERN LHC trigger system. The results show significant improvements in hardware resource utilization, design latency, and compilation speed, demonstrating the framework s practicality for ultra-low-latency FPGA applications. 1.1 Background and Related Work 1.1.1 Constant Matrix-Vector Multiplication. Constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) is a common problem in digital signal processing (DSP) applications. The problem involves computing an operation of the form 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀, where 𝑀is a constant integer matrix and 𝑥is a vector of input values. The problem is well studied in the literature, and there are multiple algorithms proposed for solving it. Distributed arithmetic (DA) is a multiplierless method for implementing the multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations in hardware by replacing them by shift-and-add (or subtract) operations, which are usually mapped to LUTs on FPGAs. The method is particularly useful for applications where extremely low latency and high throughput are required. The DA algorithm has been studied in the literature for a long time, and multiple algorithms have been proposed for solving it. Many of the existing works focus on the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem, which is a special case of CMVM where the variable vector 𝑥is of size one, commonly used in finite impulse response (FIR) filters [3], such as [24 27, 30, 41]. The works [3, 8, 9, 15, 16, 19, 44] propose algorithms for the CMVM problem, which is a more general case of the MCM problem. [15] applies CSE to the CMVM problem by recursively removing the most common two-term subexpression from the problem. [9] uses a similar approach but also takes into account the conflict between the subexpressions. In contrast, [16] uses a graph based approach, which transforms subgraphs in the constructed adder tree without increasing the maximum adder depth. Though dated more than a decade, to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art algorithm for implementing a CMVM operation with an adder tree without precision loss is still the Hcmvmalgorithm proposed in [3]. The algorithm aggressively searches for possible transformations of the CMVM problem into potentially simpler subproblems and evaluates the cost of each using a heuristic similar to [9]. The algorithm also supports specifying the maximum allowed adder depth for the generated adder tree by limiting the search phase space. However, this algorithm is computationally expensive, which requires O(1000) CPU-seconds to optimize a random 16 16, 8-bit matrix. Moreover, the runtime scaling with respect to ,𝑁, the number of non-zero signed digits required to represent the constant matrix, lies between O(𝑁3) and O(𝑁3.5). This makes it impractical for optimizing any moderately large matrices used in neural networks. In contrast, we propose a new algorithm for optimizing the CMVM problem that achieves resource efficiency comparable to [3] while significantly reducing computational cost, making it practical for larger matrices. [44] proposes a scalable algorithm for the CMVM problem, which is demonstrated to be runtime-efficient and practically useful for up to 100 100 constant matrices. Unlike previously mentioned CSE-based approaches using two-term subexpressions, the algorithm considers multi-term common subexpressions with greedy CSE for efficient processing. However, this algorithm fails to capture common subexpressions with different power-of-two scaling Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu factors, and it does not account for possible negative values in the weights. [8] adopts a similar multi-term common subexpression approach but uses a simulated annealing to optimize the cost of the adder tree for better resource utilization at the expense of algorithm runtime. While shifted common subexpressions are supported, the algorithm can only identify them in a coarse-grained fashion (i.e., a uniform shift across the whole row or column of the constant matrix). Signed digit representation is stated to be supported, but no discrete method is given, and its impact on identifying multi-term common subexpressions is not discussed. To avoid these drawbacks, we design our algorithm to effectively capture common subexpressions with different shifts and signs while preserving runtime efficiency, enabling more efficient optimization for a broader class of constant matrices. For neural networks, implementing CMVM operations without precision loss is not always required. [23] uses computation coding for approximate CMVM operations by decomposing the constant matrix into the product of multiple matrices containing only powers-of-two. By applying this method to embedded neural networks, the method demonstrates minimal accuracy loss while improving resource utilization by 3 to 6-fold. Similarly, [4] proposes another method based on 0-1 linear programming to optimize the CMVM problem approximately. However, for already highly quantized neural networks, such as those trained with HGQ or QKeras [10, 11] with low bitwidths, the weights usually carry non-negotiable gradients on the losses, and such additional approximations in the implementation stage are not preferred. Hence, in this work, we focus on the implementation of CMVM operations without any approximations, preserving full numerical precision throughout. 1.2 Ultra-Low Latency Neural Networks Neural networks with a latency requirement on the order of O(1) 𝜇s are required for the trigger systems of the Large Hadron Collider. Simultaneously, the networks are required to produce one inference at least every 25 ns. To satisfy these constraints, these neural networks are typically heavily quantized and pruned and deployed on FPGAs fully unrolled with initiation interval (II) of one [1, 12 14, 36, 38, 39]. As the networks are fully unrolled, on-chip resource consumption is of major concern. In our experience, the most resource-consuming part of the designs are usually the matrix-vector multiplications in the fully connected or convolutional layers. The standard approach for optimizing resource utilization is to quantize and prune the neural networks to reduce the resulting firmware size. In this work, we go further by introducing an efficient algorithm for optimizing CMVM operations based on distributed arithmetic, which reduces resource utilization by up to one-third and improves timing closure, enabling previously infeasible designs to meet the stringent LHC trigger system constraints. 1.3 hls4ml hls4ml [12] is a template library for translating quantized neural networks into HLS projects for FPGAs. hls4ml provides a high-level interface for users to interface popular machine learning frameworks with HLS backends, and enables users to deploy neural networks on FPGAs with minimal effort. This library is widely used for real-time inference applications. Notably, it has been deployed at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment in its L1 trigger for anomaly detection [1] and is being studied for the upgrade of the trigger system at the ATLAS experiment [36]. The library has a large built-in template library for common neural network layers, each customized and optimized for different HLS backends. In this work, we use hls4ml with the Vivado and Vitis HLS backends to implement the proposed algorithm, and we use its implementation as a baseline for comparison. Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 5 2 Problem Formulation The objective is to implement the CMVM operation, 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀, as an adder tree with minimum LUTs on FPGAs under a delay constraint. The delay constraint (DC) is defined by the maximum of additional adder depth with respect to the minimal adder depth possible. The target application of this work is the real-time inference of quantized neural networks on FPGAs targeting the LHC trigger system, with possible extension to other general DSP applications. For the target application, the neural networks are required to have an initial interval 25 ns. For this purpose, when implementing the CMVM operations with adder trees, we expect multiple adder steps within one pipeline stage. Hence, though the final design is expected to be pipelined, we expect the number of LUTs used for implementing the adders to dominate the resource utilization with moderate to low register usage. In the adder tree, the dominant operation is in the form of 𝑎 (𝑏 𝑠), where 𝑎and 𝑏are the variable inputs to the adder. The bit-shift 𝑠and the sign for the input 𝑏are known at compilation time. The expected cost of this operation is formulated as the number of full and half adders required to implement the operation (i.e., the number of output bits conditioned on more than one input). We denote the bitwidths for 𝑎and 𝑏as 𝑏𝑤𝑎and 𝑏𝑤𝑏, respectively. When there is at least one bit overlapping between the two operands (i.e., max(𝑏𝑤𝑎,𝑏𝑤𝑏) 𝑠), the simplified expected cost is given by cost(𝑏𝑤𝑎,𝑏𝑤𝑏,𝑠, sign) max(𝑏𝑤𝑎,𝑏𝑤𝑏 𝑠) min(0,𝑠) 1. (1) In practice, the logic delay of each adder with different input bitwidths will be different. However, as we notice that the majority of the delay in the adder trees is due to routing, we assume each adder to have the same delay and model the overall delay approximately by the adder depth for simplicity, following [3, 4, 16]. 3 da4ml Algorithm 3.1 Notations For a number of fixed-point type, it takes the general form of fixed 𝑆, 𝑊, 𝐼 , where 𝑆is the sign bit, 𝑊is the total bitwidth, and 𝐼is the number of integer bits including the sign bit. In the algorithm, we denote the fixed-point numbers by quantized interval, namely, by their low value, high value, and the step size, [𝑙,ℎ,𝛿]. For a generic fixed-point number in the form of fixed 𝑆, 𝑊, 𝐼 , we have 𝑙 𝑆 2(𝐼 𝑆), ℎ 2𝐼 𝑆 2 𝑊 𝐼, and 𝛿 2 𝑊 𝐼. This notation is useful to track the required bitwidths when accumulating a large number of fixed-point numbers, as otherwise one carry bit will always need to be added to prevent overflow. The notation we use in the algorithm is summarized in Table 1. In particular, 𝑀[𝑑𝑖𝑛,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡], 𝑞𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛[𝑑𝑖𝑛], 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑡[𝑑𝑖𝑛], and 𝑑𝑐are the input parameters to the algorithm for a single CMVM operation. 3.2 Overview The da4ml is a CSE-based hybrid algorithm. Like other CSE-based algorithms, the algorithm operates on a discrete representation of the constant matrix. In this work, following [3, 4, 9, 15], we adopt the canonical signed digit (CSD) [6] representation. CSD is a signed digit representation of a number that never has two consecutive non-zero digits, and the number of non-zero digits is guaranteed to be minimal. Hence, for a number with 𝑥digits, the CSD representation has at most 𝑥 2 1 non-zero digits, which is 1 3 of the total number of digits on average. As 𝑀contains only fixed-point integers, the algorithm first normalizes it by applying bit-shifts across the rows and columns such that no row column has all entries even except for zeros. The resultant scaling factors are recorded and will be applied to the input output vectors.

Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 7 3.3 First stage: Graph-based Decomposition In the first stage, the algorithm decomposes the constant matrix into two submatrices, 𝑀1 and 𝑀2 such that 𝑀 𝑀1𝑀2. Inspired by Hcmvm, we propose this stage to exploit the high-level similarity between the different columns of the constant matrix. For this purpose, we first let each column of 𝑀, 𝑀[:,𝑖] 𝑣𝑖(𝑖 [1, . . . ,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡]) be a vertex 𝑣𝑖in a graph. Then, we add the root vertex 𝑣0 associated with the zero vector 0 to the graph. The distance between two vertices 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑣𝑗is defined as the sum of the number of non-zero digits in the vector 𝑣𝑖 𝑣𝑗or 𝑣𝑖 𝑣𝑗, whichever is lower. Starting from 𝑣0 associated with 0, we use Prim s algorithm [31] to find an approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph, subject to a maximum depth smaller than or equal to 2𝑑𝑐from the root vertex. Each edge in the approximate MST is then translated back into a column vector in 𝑀1 of shape [𝑑𝑖𝑛,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡], with its contributions to the original outputs (-1, 0, or 1) recorded in the second submatrix 𝑀2 of shape [𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡]. The contribution can be determined by tracing from the root vertex to the corresponding vertex, where each edge traversed has a non-zero contribution. 𝑀2 constructed this way is usually significantly more sparse compared to 𝑀1. Both 𝑀1 and 𝑀2 are then passed to the next stage. This stage is useful for matrices with correlated columns and a high digit count. For matrices where the columns are rarely correlated, the algorithm would usually produce trivial decomposition, where 𝑀1 is a shuffled form of 𝑀and 𝑀2 is a shuffled identity matrix. As a realistic example would be too large for display, we show a minimal example of decomposing an matrix 𝑀of size 3 3: 𝑀 𝑣1 𝑣2 𝑣3 ª 0 1 3 1 2 4 2 3 5 ª (2) The graph constructed form this matrix is shown in Figure 2. In this particular example, the MST constructed is a chain of 𝑣0 𝑣1 𝑣2 𝑣3, shown by the colored edges. The corresponding column vectors to these edges are recorded in 𝑀1, and their contributions to 𝑣1, 𝑣2, and 𝑣3 are recorded in 𝑀2, where 𝑣1 is obtained by adding the first edge, 𝑣2 is obtained by adding the first two edges, and 𝑣3 is obtained by adding all three edges. 3.4 Second stage: Common Subexpression Elimination In the second stage, CSE is applied independently on 𝑀1 and 𝑀2, and the solutions are concatenated to form the final solution. For simplicity, we denote the input matrix for the second stage as just 𝑀. In this stage, 𝑀is again normalized into ˆ𝑀, which has no row or column containing all even numbers except for zeros. The algorithm then converts the input matrix to the CSD representation 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟 ( 1, 0, 1)𝑑𝑖𝑛,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡,𝐵, where 𝐵is the span of the powers of the CSD digits (i.e., the difference between the minimal and maximal bit-shifts associated with the CSD digits plus one). The CSE algorithm starts with the 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟matrix, and a list of implemented values 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙initialized with the elements of the input vector: 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 [𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑑𝑖𝑛]. These two objects defines the state of the algorithm, and the algorithm updates the state iteratively until exhausting all common subexpressions. For each update step, the algorithm selects a two-term subexpression and implements it. A two-term subexpression is defined as an operation with the general form 𝑎 𝑏 𝑠, characterized as a four-tuple: the two inputs 𝑎and 𝑏, the sign, and the bit-shift 𝑠for the second operand2. 2The order of 𝑎and 𝑏is fixed by their location in the matrix in practice for the uniqueness of the four-tuple. Manuscript submitted to ACM 8 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu Fig. 2. An example of the graph constructed from the constant matrix 𝑀in the first stage of the da4ml algorithm without a delay constraint. The graph is constructed with Prim s algorithm, and the MST is shown in colored edges. The root vertex 𝑣0 is on the bottom left. The column vectors on the edges are the corresponding vectors that need to be added subtracted to transform between the two connected vertices. The number after the column vectors is the number of non-zero digits needed to represent the vector, and the smaller of the two is used as the edge weight. The column vectors corresponding to the edges in the MST are stored in 𝑀1, and their contributions to 𝑣1, 𝑣2, and 𝑣3 are recorded in 𝑀2. Implementing a two-term subexpression consists of two steps. The algorithm first appends the result of the two-term subexpression to the list of implemented values 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙. Then, it appends an empty row to 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟. For every occurrence of the subexpression in 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟, the algorithm sets the corresponding two digits to zero and sets -1 or 1 on the new row at the corresponding power. At all times, the value of Í 𝑗𝑣𝑗ˆ𝑀𝑗𝑖can be recovered with Í 𝑗,𝑠2𝑠 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙[𝑗] ˆ𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟[𝑗,𝑖,𝑠]. In the implementation, we keep a hash table that caches the frequency of all two-term subexpressions to speed up the optimization. While [3, 9] show that selecting the two-term subexpression that minimally conflicts with the other subexpressions could result in lower final adder usage, this approach requires a one-step look-ahead operation when selecting the two-term common subexpression in each update step, which involves a complexity of O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 2). Due to practical considerations for larger matrices, we instead select the most common subexpression to implement for each update step, which can be performed with a complexity of O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 ). As 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 is of the same order of magnitude as the total number of non-zero digits in 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟, the additional time complexity for performing the look-ahead operation would be substantial. As suggested in [3], because this only improves the final resource utilization by less than 2 as measured in adder count, we decided that the additional complexity is not worth the runtime overhead. In contrast to [15], we also take into account the operands quantized intervals (i.e., the bitwidths and shift) when choosing the subexpression for each update step. As implied by the cost function in (1), it is preferred to have the two operands with similar bitwidths and shifts. However, directly weighting the frequency of the two-term subexpressions by the total cost is not ideal: it would also count the half-adders used, which are "overheads" as they may unnecessarily increase the accumulator width downstream. Instead, we weight the frequency by the number of overlapping bits between the two operands. This weighting reduces to a constant factor when the input bitwidths are uniform and significantly larger than the constant matrix s bitwidths. We show a minimal example of the second stage in Figure 3 with a constant matrix from the H.264 integer trans- form [42]. For presentation purposes, the matrix shown is a transposed matrix (i.e., 𝑦 𝑀 𝑥instead of 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀). In this minimal example, we do not weight the frequency of the subexpressions by the operand bitwidths for simplicity. Also, Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 9 please note that although the example matrix contains only power-of-two numbers, the algorithm accepts matrices with arbitrary fixed-point elements. The algorithm first identifies three two-term subexpressions, shown in the bounding boxes with the same color. In the first step, the expression 𝑥0 𝑥3 has the highest frequency and is implemented, and all of its occurrences are replaced. The algorithm then proceeds to implement the other two subexpressions. The adder graphs before and after optimization are shown in Figure 4, where the original adder graph requiring 12 adders on the left is reduced to 8 adders on the right. 1 1 1 1 2 1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -2 2 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -2 2 1 0 0 2 -2 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 x0 x1 x2 x3 y0 y1 y2 y3 x0 x1 x2 x3 x0 x3 0 0 1 -1 0 0 -2 2 0 0 2 -2 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 x0 x1 x2 x3 x0 x3 x1 x2 1 0 -1 0 0 0 2 -2 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 x0 x3 x0 x3 x1 x2 x1-x2 1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 -2 Fig. 3.

For representation purposes, the matrix shown is a transposed matrix (i.e., 𝑦 𝑀 𝑥 instead of 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀). The first subexpression 𝑥0 𝑥3 has the highest frequency and is implemented first, followed by the other two subexpressions. Frequency weighting by operand bitwidths is not applied in this example for simplicity. In each step, the subexpressions with a colored shade are eliminated. In the last step, the all-zero columns and corresponding elements in the implemented values are omitted. -2 2 -1 1 Fig. 4.

Enabling the DA strategy on all supported layers in hls4ml using our framework. 3.5 Complexity Analysis and Performance For complexity analysis, we denote the bitwidth of the constant matrix 𝑀as 𝑏𝑤𝑀, and the number of inputs and outputs as 𝑑𝑖𝑛and 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡, respectively. Let 𝑁 𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑏𝑤𝑀. The complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the second stage. As the first stage is a constrained variation of the Prim s algorithm, the complexity of the first stage is bounded O(𝑑2 𝑜𝑢𝑡). For the second stage, we found that the complexity is dominated by optimizing 𝑀1, for which it is similar to optimizing 𝑀directly. Initializing the hash table requires a complexity of O 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑏𝑤𝑀)2 for double iteration over the input dimensions and single iteration over the output expressions. O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 ) O(𝑁) update steps are required to reach the final solution. For each step, the complexity is O(𝑁) to find the most common two-term subexpression over a cached dictionary. Each frequency update also takes O(𝑁) time, as only single iteration over the input dimensions is required for differential updates. Hence, the overall asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is expected to be O(𝑁2), dominated by the iterative update steps. In practice, we found the execution time of the algorithm to be asymptotically close to O(𝑁2 log(𝑁)2) up to 𝑁 105 (128 128 8-bit). We postulate that the logarithmic factor is due to the overhead of the hash table or memory allocation deallocation when appending rows to the 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟matrix. 4 Implementation and Integration da4ml is implemented as a high-performance Python library and is open-sourced at At its core, da4ml leverages Numba [20], a just-in-time compiler for Python that compiles code to MLIR and then to a binary with LLVM [21] for performance considerations. Designed for seamless deployment, the library is tightly integrated with the widely adopted hls4ml framework [12]. Users can easily enable da4ml by setting the strategy to distributed_arithmetic for any layer requiring CMVM operations, as shown in Listing 1. No further user configuration or intervention is required. The overall workflow is shown in Figure 5. In this workflow, da4ml generates an optimized adder tree for the CMVM operation in HLS C code, which is then used as a drop-in replacement for the default CMVM implementation within the hls4ml. This drop-in integration enables significant improvements in resource efficiency and latency without sacrificing usability. Currently, the Dense, EinsumDense, and Conv1D Conv2D layers are supported for the Vivado Vitis backends, with plans for broader support underway. By bridging algorithmic innovation with production-ready toolchains, da4ml provides a scalable and practical solution for deploying high-throughput, low-latency neural networks on FPGAs.

The workflow of using the da4ml library with the hls4ml library. The da4ml library generates the optimized adder tree for the CMVM operation in HLS C code, which is send to the hls4ml library for drop-in replacement of the default CMVM implementation. 5 Experiments In this section, we first evaluate the proposed da4ml algorithm on random matrices and compare the high-level metrics with the state-of-the-art Hcmvmalgorithm. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on realistic neural networks consisting CMVM operations. We perform both the HLS version and hardware-description-language (HDL) version of the algorithm. The HLS version is implemented with the hls4ml library [12], and the HDL version is implemented standalone with the da4ml library. 5.1 Random Matrices We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on random 𝑚 𝑚matrices. In this subsection, to facilitate comparison with the Hcmvmalgorithm, we adopt a convention from [3] where a 𝑏𝑤-bit random matrix is generated by sampling integers uniformly from [2𝑏𝑤 1 1, 2𝑏𝑤 1]. 𝑑𝑐 1 (no delay constraint) 𝑑𝑐 0 𝑑𝑐 2 da4ml Hcmvm [3] da4ml Hcmvm [3] da4ml Hcmvm [3] N step adder cpu [ms] step adder cpu [ms] step adder cpu [ms] step adder cpu [ms] step adder cpu [ms] step adder 2 3.3 8.7 0.1 4.4 8.2 1.0e1 3.1 9.9 0.1 3.1 8.8 1.0e1 3.3 8.7 0.1 3.7 8.2 4 6.1 29.3 0.3 7.8 27.6 4.8e2 4.1 37. 0.3 4.1 32.1 4.7e2 5.9 30. 0.3 5.7 28.1 6 8.4 59. 0.6 10. 57.3 3.3e3 5. 77.8 0.8 5. 66.8 3.8e3 6.7 62.6 0.6 7. 58.2 8 9.4 98. 1.3 11.9 96.3 1.5e4 5.1 130.9 2. 5.1 117.2 1.7e4 7. 102.3 1.4 7.1 99.5 1 10.8 146.6 2.7 13.2 143.5 5.4e4 6. 195.6 4.2 6. 157.7 8.2e4 7.8 152.8 2.8 8. 146.9 12 11.6 203.6 4.8 14.6 200.4 1.7e5 6. 271.8 7.9 6. 241.6 1.7e5 8. 214.9 5.2 8. 206.8 14 12.3 269.3 8.3 15.5 264.3 4.8e5 6. 358.5 14.1 6. 324. 4.2e5 8. 279.2 8.9 8. 274.8 16 13. 343.4 13.3 16.3 338.3 1.2e6 6. 456. 22.5 6. 423.2 9.9e5 8. 358.7 14.9 8. 353.3 Table 2. Comparison of the da4ml algorithm with the Hcmvm algorithm on random matrices. In Table 2, we show the comparison of the da4ml algorithm with the Hcmvm algorithm on random matrices with 8-bits under different delay constraints. For each configuration, we report the adder depth (denoted as step ), total number of adders, and runtime on CPU. Results are shown for three delay constraint settings: no constraint, strict delay constraint (𝑑𝑐 0), and moderate delay constraint (𝑑𝑐 2). The CPU time is measured on a single thread of an Intel i7-13700 CPU for da4ml, and on a single thread of an Intel Xeon at 2.33 GHz for Hcmvm, as reported by the authors. The table shows the number of adders used in the optimized design of both algorithms under the same delay constraints, Manuscript submitted to ACM 12 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu and the adder depth (step) of both. When delay constraint is not exactly 0, the proposed algorithm has 2 overhead in adder counts compared to the Hcmvm algorithm. When strict delay constraint is required, the proposed algorithm has a larger overhead of 8 in adder counts. Please note that this slight trade-off in resource usage yields dramatic improvements in compilation speed. With respect to runtime, the da4ml algorithm is significantly more efficient, being O(100000) times faster than the Hcmvm algorithm with a moderate matrix size of 16 16. The difference would be more significant for larger matrices given the difference in asymptotic complexities. Although there is a generation gap between the two CPU processors, the magnitude of the observed speedup far exceeds what can be attributed solely to CPU differences, highlighting the efficiency and scalability of our framework. We further show extended runtime results for larger matrices in Figure 6 the computation time of the da4ml algorithm on random matrices with up to 128 128 elements with 8 bits, as well as the time expected from the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm. These results demostrate that the da4ml algorithm may handle reasonably complex CMVM problems that may be implemented on FPGAs unrolled in reasonable time. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Size of constant matrix (m) 10 3 10 1 101 103 105 Average CPU time (ms) Actual time O(m4 log2 m) Fig. 6. Computation time of the da4ml algorithm on random matrices with different sizes. The asymptotic complexity is O(𝑁2 log(𝑁)2), where 𝑁 𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑏𝑤𝑀. The log(𝑁)2 factor was found empirically. We show the post-synthesis results of the proposed da4ml algorithm on random matrices with 8 bits and 4 bits, shown in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. The results shown in this section are obtained after HLS synthesis with Vitis 2023.2 and out-of-context synthesis and place-and-route with the Vivado 2023.2 backend. The target FPGA is xcvu13p-flga2577-2-e. To quantify the logic delay, the designs are synthesized with a latency of one clock cycle, where the CMVM logic is a combinational logic block sandwiched between two layers of registers. For each matrix size, we use the same random constant matrix for the three delay constraints: 0, 2, and -1 (no constraint), marked as DC in the tables. The baseline for comparison is the latency-optimized implementation in hls4ml, where an unrolled double for-loop is used to implement the CMVM operation with a fixed-point multiplication-accumulation operation for HLS. The inputs for all designs are 8-bit signed integers. Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 13 As shown in Table 3, the da4ml approach completely avoids using DSP blocks. In cases where the baseline also relies on LUTs for multiplication (e.g., Table 4 or the 8 8 matrix in Table 3), da4ml can consistently reduce LUT usage by approximately half. When the baseline utilizes DSPs, the LUT usage is comparable, though it can be significantly reduced by relaxing the delay constraint. For latency, the critical path of the da4ml designs can be either shorter or longer than the baseline, depending on the chosen bitwidth and delay constraint.

Resource utilization and latency of the da4ml algorithm on random matrices with different sizes and delay constraints. Strategy latency is the latency-optimized algorithm in hls4ml, and DA is the optimized implementation with the da4ml algorithm. The delay constraint is set to 0, 2, or -1, where -1 means no delay constraint. The matrix size is 𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡, and the bitwidth is 8. The input bitwidth is 8 in all cases. 5.2 Realistic Neural Networks We show the performance of the da4ml algorithm on realistic neural networks with CMVM operations. The networks are trained with the HGQ [10] library. It is worth noting these neural networks trained with HGQ have heterogeneous bitwidths within one CMVM operation, i.e., there is a high bit-wise sparsity in the constant matrix and the inputs. Due to the extremely heterogeneous bitwidths, da4ml s benefit is less significant than the random matrix case. Based on the results from the previous section, we found delay constraint of 2 is a good trade-off between resource utilization and latency, and we use it for all evaluations in this section. 5.2.1 High-level Feature Jet Tagging Network. We show the out-of-context results after place-and-route for the high-level feature jet tagging network [12] on the VU13P FPGA. The network is a fully-connected neural network with 4 dense layers of sizes 16 64 32 16 16 5. In Table 5 and Table 6, we show the resource utilization and latency of the network synthesized against target clock frequencies of 200 MHz and 1 GHz, respectively. Vitis 2023.2 is used for HLS synthesis, and the total latency is not specified but left to the HLS tool. All designs are fully pipelined with an II of 1 clock cycle. When the target clock frequency is 200 MHz, the designs optimized with the da4ml algorithm always meet the timing constraints, whereas hls4ml s latency-optimized designs failed to meet timing for the model with 76.9 accuracy.

Resource utilization and latency of the da4ml algorithm on random matrices with different sizes and delay constraints.

The delay constraint is set to 0, 2, or -1, where -1 means no delay constraint. The matrix size is 𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡, and the bitwidth is 4. The input bitwidth is 8 in all cases. cases, da4ml reduces LUT consumption by 10 for this network. To obtain the maximum frequency, we resynthesized the designs with a target clock frequency of 1 GHz. Under this setting, the designs optimized with the da4ml algorithm are pipelined with fewer stages and achieve Fmax values similar to or higher than the baseline hls4ml designs. As more registers are inserted, LUT fusion and sharing are less effective, and the LUT utilization is higher than for the designs with a 200 MHz target clock frequency. The DSP utilization is reduced to 0 in all cases with da4ml.

We show the out-of-context results after place route for the SVHN classification network [12] on the VU9P FPGA.

In contrast to other networks shown in this work, resource takes place in these networks for the convolution filters applying to different inputs The designs are synthesized with Vivado HLS 2020.1 due to inconsistent behaviors of the DATAFLOW pragma used in hls4ml. More details for these networks can be found in [10]. The target clock frequency is set to 200 MHz, and the delay constraint is set to 2 for each CMVM operation. The results are shown in Table 7. From the table, it can be seen that the designs optimized with da4ml can reduce the LUT utilization by 1 4, while removing all DSPs. No timing violations are observed in all cases.

As the inputs of this network are all 1-bit, we do not apply da4ml to the initial convolutional layers, as they can be efficiently implemented using conditional accumulation logic. All implementations shown have an II of 1 clock cycle. Compared to the latency-optimized baseline from hls4ml, the da4ml-optimized designs not only reduce LUT utilization by approximately 10 but also entirely eliminate DSP usage. All designs met timing, while the latency- optimized designs in hls4ml are pipelined with more stages and have higher latency.

The particle-based jet tagging network [37] is an MLP Mixer based neural network for jet tagging. We adopt the architecture from [37] with the 64-particle input, and 16-features per particle. The network is trained with the HGQ library [10]. The architecture is shown in Figure 9. For this neural network, Vitis HLS 2023.2 cannot produce designs with II of 1 clock cycle when using the original hls4ml implementation. We suspect the issue is related to the multidimensional linear operation implemented with Einstein Summation templates, and some pragma usage used may be inappropriate. However, we do not investigate this issue further as it is beyond the scope of this work. The results are shown in Table 9. The designs are synthesized with Vitis HLS 2023.2 and Vivado 2023.2, with a target clock frequency set to 200 MHz and a target II of 1.

The architecture of the particle-based jet tagging network [37]. The network is an MLP Mixer based neural network for jet tagging. The architecture is adopted from [37] with the 64-particle input, and 16-features per particle (𝑁 64 and 𝑛 16). The model consists of four MLP blocks with a single skip-connection. The implementation of each MLP and the classification head is shown in the corresponding dashed blocks. MLP1 and MLP3 act on the feature dimension; MLP2 and MLP4 act on the particle dimension.

The workflow of the standalone workflow with da4ml. The user defines the network in a functional style, and the code generation is performed with da4ml to generate synthesizable, pipelined Verilog code. 5.3 Standalone Code Generation Other than the main workflow introduced in Section 4, da4ml can also work standalone to generate Verilog designs for a subset of neural networks, allowing for easier integration into existing RTL workflows. Currently, the generated designs must be either fully pipelined with an II of 1 or combinational. In addition, da4ml only supports networks with generalized CMVM operations (i.e., including convolution and Einstein Summation between constants and inputs), arithmetic operations excluding division, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations for standalone code generation. In the current implementation, manually defining the network in a functional style is required, and the workflow is shown in Figure 10. Pipelining of the generated design is performed by layers of adders, in which each adder is assumed to have a constant latency. While this approximation is not accurate, we use it to simplify the pipelining process, as we notice that routing delay dominates the latency in most cases in our experiments and more complex modeling of the adders latency does not yield significant improvements. We also reserve an API for the user to specify the latency of each adder depending on the bitwidths of the operands. We show the performance of the high-level feature jet tagging network with 200 MHz and 1 GHz target clock frequencies in Table 10 and Table 11, and the results for the particle-based jet tagging network with MLP Mixer in Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 19 Implementation Accuracy Latency [cycles] LUT DSP FF Fmax [MHz] hls4ml DA 76.9 4 (18.9 ns) 12,250 0 1,502 211.5 da4ml 4 (20.0 ns) 12,032 0 3,113 200.1 hls4ml DA 76.6 3 (13.3 ns) 6,869 0 966 226.0 da4ml 4 (19.5 ns) 6,153 0 1,775 205.4 hls4ml DA 76.5 3 (13.1 ns) 6,005 0 871 229.6 da4ml 4 (19.8 ns) 5,613 0 1,539 202.0 hls4ml DA 76.3 3 (12.8 ns) 4,728 0 786 234.1 da4ml 3 (14.8 ns) 4,129 0 903 202.4 hls4ml DA 76.0 3 (12.3 ns) 3,308 0 661 244.8 da4ml 3 (14.9 ns) 2,814 0 628 201.0 hls4ml DA 75.9 3 (12.8 ns) 2,878 0 601 234.0 da4ml 3 (14.7 ns) 2,485 0 683 204.2 Table 10.

II is 1 for all designs shown. pipelined with more stages than the adder graph depth, which suggests that the HLS compiler is further breaking down the graph for timing optimization, a process not performed in the standalone code generation. We suspect this is the reason for the lower Fmax in the designs generated with da4ml. It is worth noting that designs generated with da4ml directly can significantly reduce compilation time: for designs with a large amount of code, HLS can take a very long time. For instance, the synthesis time for the particle-based jet tagging networks3 with Vitis HLS and Vivado 2023.2 is around 17 hours without memory bottleneck when optimized with da4ml. However, the designs of the same networks generated directly in Verilog with da4ml only take around 26 minutes to synthesize with Vivado 2023.2. The peak memory usage also significantly reduced from 70 GB to 10 GB. These results suggest that da4ml s standalone code generation can facilitate fast prototyping and allowing for faster iterations in software-hardware co-design. 5.4 Comparison to Other Methods While this work focuses on distributed arithmetic optimization for CMVM operations in FPGA-based neural networks, alternative methods exist for implementing machine learning-based models on FPGAs. In this section, we briefly compare neural networks optimized with da4ml to other methods. We show the comparasion in Table 13, where we compare the performance of the networks shown in earlier sections against other state-of-the-art methods. It is important to differentiate our approach from methods such as TreeLUT [18], NeuraLUT-Assemble [5], and DWN [7]. While da4ml optimizes the implementation of quantized traditional neural networks, these methods re- formulates the entire model into inherently hardware-native structures. In particular, TreeLUT defines the model as collection of quantized decision trees, while NeuraLUT-Assemble and DWN construct models directly mapped into LUTs with particular fan-in. These methods are highly specialized and may achieve exceptional efficiency in terms of resource utilization and throughput, while they often come at the cost of reduced generalizability and slight accuracy degradation. In contrast, da4ml focuses on optimizing the core CMVM operations of quantized, conventional neural networks, which would enable more straightforward integration with existing machine learning workflows and is applicable on more complex tasks. In particular, we show that when the network is properly quantized with HGQ [10], 3All-inclusive time, until routing finishes Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 21 High-level feature jet tagging network Implementation Accuracy Latency [cycles] LUT DSP FF Fmax [MHz] II [cycles] This Work: HGQ da4ml (HLS) 76.9 31 (44.1 ns) 12,682 0 19,056 702.2 1 This Work: HGQ da4ml (RTL) 76.5 17 (23.1 ns) 6,165 0 7,207 735.8 1 This Work: HGQ hls4ml 76.9 42 (57.6 ns) 16,081 57 26,484 729.4 1 This Work: HGQ hls4ml 76.5 35 (67.2 ns) 8,548 30 14,418 520.8 1 QKeras hls4ml [34] 76.3 15 (105 ns) 5,504 175 3,036 142.9 2 DWN [7] 76.3 10 (14.4 ns) 6,302 0 4,128 695. 1 MetaML-Pro [32] 76.1 10 (50 ns) 13,042 70 N A 200 1 NeuraLUT-Assemble [5] 76.0 2 (2.1 ns) 1,780 0 540 940. 1 TreeLUT [18] 75.6 2 (2.7 ns) 2,234 0 347 735. 1 Muon tracking network Implementation Resolution [mrad] Latency [cycles] LUT DSP FF Fmax [MHz] II [cycles] This Work: HGQ da4ml (HLS) 1.95 9 (55.4 ns) 37,125 0 5,547 162.5 1 HGQ hls4ml [10] 1.95 11 (67.5 ns) 39,413 522 6,043 162.9 1 QKeras hls4ml [36] 1.95 17 (106.3 ns) 37,867 1,762 8,443 160 1 SVHN classification network Implementation Accuracy Latency [cycles] LUT DSP FF Fmax [MHz] II [cycles] This Work: HGQ da4ml (HLS) 93.9 1,045 (5,159.2 ns) 53,425 0 20,048 202.6 1,029 HGQ hls4ml [10] 93.9 1,050 (5,058.9 ns) 69,407 58 27,853 207.6 1,029 QKeras hls4ml [2] 94. 1,035 (5,175 ns) 111,152 174 32,554 200 1,030 QKeras hls4ml [34] 92.4 5,447 (43,576 ns) 59,279 1,215 46,584 125 N A Particle-based jet tagging network Implementation Accuracy Latency [cycles] LUT DSP FF Fmax [MHz] II [cycles] This Work: HGQ da4ml (RTL) 81.4 11 (54.8 ns) 120,512 0 28,284 200.8 1 LL-GNN [33] 81.2 181 (905 ns) 815k 8,986 189k 200 150 QKeras hls4ml, DS [29] 75.9 26 (130 ns) 903,284 434 358,754 200 2 QKeras hls4ml, GNN [29] 75.8 32 (160 ns) 1,162,104 2,120 761,061 200 3 Table 13. Resource and performance of various neural network tasks with different implementations. When the neural network is quantized with HGQ [10], we show that traditional neural networks may achieve competitive resource utilization, throughput, and superior accuracy compared with the methods designed specifically for FPGAs. All works are using either xcvu13p-flga2577-2-e or xcvu9p-flgb2104-2-i, where the results are comparable. da4ml (HLS) refers to using da4ml with the hls4ml workflow, while da4ml (RTL) refers to the standalone workflow. Works marked with report the results after logic synthesis without place and route. We put the target clock frequency for Fmax and used it to compute the latency for these works. DWN results are cited from [5] instead, as the original paper omits preprocessing steps for the firmware implementation, which are added in [5] for a fair comparison. Works marked with reports resource utilization after place and routes, but did not report Fmax. We use the achieved target clock as Fmax for these works. traditional neural networks can achieve competitive resource utilization throughput - accuracy tradeoff compared to those methods highly co-designed for FPGAs. Comparing to other conventional neural network based methods shown in Table 13, our proposed da4ml framework demonstrates significant advantage across diverse workloads, offering a favorable balance between accuracy, latency, and hardware efficiency. Notably, our designs consistently eliminate DSP usage while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy, making them suited for resource-constrained FPGA designs. Similarly, in the muon tracking and SVHN classification tasks, our method matches the accuracy of existing approaches while reducing LUT and flip-flop utilization. Furthermore, the particle-based jet tagging design achieves the highest accuracy (81.4 ) while consuming more than 10 fewer LUTs and FFs than state-of-the-art GNN-based implementations. Across all tasks, our designs Manuscript submitted to ACM 22 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu maintain a consistent II of 1 cycle, ensuring high-throughput operation. These results underscore the generalizability and practicality of our approach for low-latency, resource-efficient FPGA deployment in both traditional and physics-inspired neural networks. 6 Conclusion In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for optimizing CMVM operations with distributed arithmetic for FPGA- based neural networks. We further present the da4ml library, which implements the algorithm efficiently and tightly integrates it with the hls4ml library for easy adoption. We then demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of neural networks, including dense, convolutional, and MLP-Mixer-based networks. The results show that designs optimized with da4ml can simultaneously reduce resource utilization and timing on realistic, heavily quantized, and sparse neural networks for physics applications. We also show that for a limited set of networks, da4ml can generate Verilog designs directly for fast prototyping and software-hardware co-design. The results show that designs generated directly with da4ml could further reduce resource utilization and synthesis time significantly at the expense of a slightly lower Fmax. We hope this work will facilitate the design of efficient neural networks for FPGAs, especially in the context of physics applications, and provide a solid foundation for future work on hardware-aware neural network design. 7 Acknowledgments Chang Sun and Maria Spiropulu are partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of High Energy Physics grant DE-SC0011925.

While typical real-time inference applications have latency constraints of a few milliseconds [17, 28, 43], certain specific applications require sub-microsecond inference latency. For instance, at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [40], hundreds of terabytes of data are generated by the detectors every second from proton-proton collisions at a rate of 4 MHz. This enormous data throughput is reduced by a hardware system, 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟, which filters the data in real-time at the same rate. It determines which event should be kept for offline processing or discarded, and the final decision must be made within a few microseconds [38, 39].

O(1000) field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are currently used in the trigger system, where several algorithms run in parallel on each FPGA. As a result, resources are scarce, and the footprint of each algorithm must be minimal. In anticipation of the LHC s upgrade to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [45], Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being actively explored to enhance the current trigger system [1, 38, 39]. However, integrating demanding models under such strict resource and latency constraints remains challenging. To meet the latency requirements, the neural networks used in such applications are typically deployed on FPGAs fully unrolled and pipelined (usually with an initiation interval of one). hls4ml, a free and open-source library for synthesizing deployable firmware for running neural network inferences on FPGAs, is widely used for implementing such neural networks on FPGAs [1, 12 14, 36, 38, 39]. The library parses the architectures of the neural networks and generates the corresponding high-level synthesis (HLS) projects for FPGAs with a set of fixed templates for common neural network layers or operations. The generated HLS projects are then synthesized into hardware description language (HDL) code by the corresponding HLS backends. Frequently, the most resource-consuming part of the designs are the constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) operations in the neural networks, such as those in the dense or convolutional layers. As the final design is fully unrolled, the CMVM operations are typically implemented primarily with distributed arithmetic (DA) [27] by the HLS backends, as suggested by the high lookup-table (LUT) utilization with moderate to low digital signal processor (DSP) utilization in the synthesized designs. In this work, we present da4ml, a fast, scalable, and accurate optimization framework for CMVM targeting ultra- low-latency neural networks on FPGAs.\n\n--- Segment 4 ---\nAs the final design is fully unrolled, the CMVM operations are typically implemented primarily with distributed arithmetic (DA) [27] by the HLS backends, as suggested by the high lookup-table (LUT) utilization with moderate to low digital signal processor (DSP) utilization in the synthesized designs. In this work, we present da4ml, a fast, scalable, and accurate optimization framework for CMVM targeting ultra- low-latency neural networks on FPGAs. Most existing exact multiplierless CMVM algorithms are either too slow (e.g., 𝐻𝑐𝑚𝑣𝑚: O(𝑁3)1 time [3], hours for moderate-size matrices), or miss significant opportunities for optimization (e.g., SCMVM: O(𝑁2) time [44], but cannot capture differently scaled subexpressions). The proposed da4ml combines a novel graph-based decomposition with cost-aware Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE), which retains full numerical precision (not approximate), captures subexpression reuse even across differently scaled terms and signed digits, and has a much better asymptotic complexity O(𝑁2) and a five-orders-of-magnitude faster runtime (Table 2). This makes it practical for realistic, large-scale networks in ultra-low-latency environments such as the CERN LHC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source, end-to-end DA-based neural network compiler with optimized CMVM operations. By tightly integrating our framework with hls4ml, it provides a drop-in complement for the default CMVM implementation in hls4ml. This tight integration into an established toolchain (the hls4ml workflow) lowers the barrier to adoption for the broader HEP and FPGA communities. The framework also supports direct RTL generation without going through HLS for fast prototyping and easier integration into existing RTL workflows. The practical impact of the proposed framework has been demonstrated by enabling the production deployment of the AXOL1TL [1] anomaly detection trigger at the CMS experiment, where it significantly improves the resource utilization and timing closure of the synthesized design.\n\n--- Segment 5 ---\nThe framework also supports direct RTL generation without going through HLS for fast prototyping and easier integration into existing RTL workflows.

It offers orders of magnitude faster runtime than the prior state of the art while achieving comparable resource efficiency. 1𝑁is the number of non-zero signed digits needed to represent the constant matrix. Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 3 We implement the proposed da4ml framework as an open-source library and tightly integrate it into the widely used hls4ml tool as a drop-in solution for FPGA-based ML designs. da4ml can also generate synthesizable RTL directly, allowing users to bypass HLS where needed. In addition, da4ml has enabled production deployment of the AXOL1TL [1] anomaly detection trigger at CMS with improved resource efficiency and timing closure. We evaluate the proposed framework on both synthetic CMVM benchmarks and realistic neural networks for the CERN LHC trigger system. The results show significant improvements in hardware resource utilization, design latency, and compilation speed, demonstrating the framework s practicality for ultra-low-latency FPGA applications. 1.1 Background and Related Work 1.1.1 Constant Matrix-Vector Multiplication. Constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) is a common problem in digital signal processing (DSP) applications. The problem involves computing an operation of the form 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀, where 𝑀is a constant integer matrix and 𝑥is a vector of input values. The problem is well studied in the literature, and there are multiple algorithms proposed for solving it. Distributed arithmetic (DA) is a multiplierless method for implementing the multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations in hardware by replacing them by shift-and-add (or subtract) operations, which are usually mapped to LUTs on FPGAs.\n\n--- Segment 6 ---\nThe problem is well studied in the literature, and there are multiple algorithms proposed for solving it. Distributed arithmetic (DA) is a multiplierless method for implementing the multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations in hardware by replacing them by shift-and-add (or subtract) operations, which are usually mapped to LUTs on FPGAs. The method is particularly useful for applications where extremely low latency and high throughput are required. The DA algorithm has been studied in the literature for a long time, and multiple algorithms have been proposed for solving it. Many of the existing works focus on the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem, which is a special case of CMVM where the variable vector 𝑥is of size one, commonly used in finite impulse response (FIR) filters [3], such as [24 27, 30, 41]. The works [3, 8, 9, 15, 16, 19, 44] propose algorithms for the CMVM problem, which is a more general case of the MCM problem. [15] applies CSE to the CMVM problem by recursively removing the most common two-term subexpression from the problem. [9] uses a similar approach but also takes into account the conflict between the subexpressions. In contrast, [16] uses a graph based approach, which transforms subgraphs in the constructed adder tree without increasing the maximum adder depth. Though dated more than a decade, to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art algorithm for implementing a CMVM operation with an adder tree without precision loss is still the Hcmvmalgorithm proposed in [3]. The algorithm aggressively searches for possible transformations of the CMVM problem into potentially simpler subproblems and evaluates the cost of each using a heuristic similar to [9]. The algorithm also supports specifying the maximum allowed adder depth for the generated adder tree by limiting the search phase space. However, this algorithm is computationally expensive, which requires O(1000) CPU-seconds to optimize a random 16 16, 8-bit matrix. Moreover, the runtime scaling with respect to ,𝑁, the number of non-zero signed digits required to represent the constant matrix, lies between O(𝑁3) and O(𝑁3.5). This makes it impractical for optimizing any moderately large matrices used in neural networks.\n\n--- Segment 7 ---\nMoreover, the runtime scaling with respect to ,𝑁, the number of non-zero signed digits required to represent the constant matrix, lies between O(𝑁3) and O(𝑁3.5). This makes it impractical for optimizing any moderately large matrices used in neural networks. In contrast, we propose a new algorithm for optimizing the CMVM problem that achieves resource efficiency comparable to [3] while significantly reducing computational cost, making it practical for larger matrices. [44] proposes a scalable algorithm for the CMVM problem, which is demonstrated to be runtime-efficient and practically useful for up to 100 100 constant matrices. Unlike previously mentioned CSE-based approaches using two-term subexpressions, the algorithm considers multi-term common subexpressions with greedy CSE for efficient processing. However, this algorithm fails to capture common subexpressions with different power-of-two scaling Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu factors, and it does not account for possible negative values in the weights. [8] adopts a similar multi-term common subexpression approach but uses a simulated annealing to optimize the cost of the adder tree for better resource utilization at the expense of algorithm runtime. While shifted common subexpressions are supported, the algorithm can only identify them in a coarse-grained fashion (i.e., a uniform shift across the whole row or column of the constant matrix). Signed digit representation is stated to be supported, but no discrete method is given, and its impact on identifying multi-term common subexpressions is not discussed. To avoid these drawbacks, we design our algorithm to effectively capture common subexpressions with different shifts and signs while preserving runtime efficiency, enabling more efficient optimization for a broader class of constant matrices. For neural networks, implementing CMVM operations without precision loss is not always required. [23] uses computation coding for approximate CMVM operations by decomposing the constant matrix into the product of multiple matrices containing only powers-of-two. By applying this method to embedded neural networks, the method demonstrates minimal accuracy loss while improving resource utilization by 3 to 6-fold. Similarly, [4] proposes another method based on 0-1 linear programming to optimize the CMVM problem approximately.\n\n--- Segment 8 ---\nBy applying this method to embedded neural networks, the method demonstrates minimal accuracy loss while improving resource utilization by 3 to 6-fold. Similarly, [4] proposes another method based on 0-1 linear programming to optimize the CMVM problem approximately. However, for already highly quantized neural networks, such as those trained with HGQ or QKeras [10, 11] with low bitwidths, the weights usually carry non-negotiable gradients on the losses, and such additional approximations in the implementation stage are not preferred. Hence, in this work, we focus on the implementation of CMVM operations without any approximations, preserving full numerical precision throughout. 1.2 Ultra-Low Latency Neural Networks Neural networks with a latency requirement on the order of O(1) 𝜇s are required for the trigger systems of the Large Hadron Collider. Simultaneously, the networks are required to produce one inference at least every 25 ns. To satisfy these constraints, these neural networks are typically heavily quantized and pruned and deployed on FPGAs fully unrolled with initiation interval (II) of one [1, 12 14, 36, 38, 39]. As the networks are fully unrolled, on-chip resource consumption is of major concern. In our experience, the most resource-consuming part of the designs are usually the matrix-vector multiplications in the fully connected or convolutional layers. The standard approach for optimizing resource utilization is to quantize and prune the neural networks to reduce the resulting firmware size. In this work, we go further by introducing an efficient algorithm for optimizing CMVM operations based on distributed arithmetic, which reduces resource utilization by up to one-third and improves timing closure, enabling previously infeasible designs to meet the stringent LHC trigger system constraints. 1.3 hls4ml hls4ml [12] is a template library for translating quantized neural networks into HLS projects for FPGAs. hls4ml provides a high-level interface for users to interface popular machine learning frameworks with HLS backends, and enables users to deploy neural networks on FPGAs with minimal effort. This library is widely used for real-time inference applications.\n\n--- Segment 9 ---\nhls4ml provides a high-level interface for users to interface popular machine learning frameworks with HLS backends, and enables users to deploy neural networks on FPGAs with minimal effort. This library is widely used for real-time inference applications. Notably, it has been deployed at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment in its L1 trigger for anomaly detection [1] and is being studied for the upgrade of the trigger system at the ATLAS experiment [36]. The library has a large built-in template library for common neural network layers, each customized and optimized for different HLS backends. In this work, we use hls4ml with the Vivado and Vitis HLS backends to implement the proposed algorithm, and we use its implementation as a baseline for comparison. Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 5 2 Problem Formulation The objective is to implement the CMVM operation, 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀, as an adder tree with minimum LUTs on FPGAs under a delay constraint. The delay constraint (DC) is defined by the maximum of additional adder depth with respect to the minimal adder depth possible. The target application of this work is the real-time inference of quantized neural networks on FPGAs targeting the LHC trigger system, with possible extension to other general DSP applications. For the target application, the neural networks are required to have an initial interval 25 ns. For this purpose, when implementing the CMVM operations with adder trees, we expect multiple adder steps within one pipeline stage. Hence, though the final design is expected to be pipelined, we expect the number of LUTs used for implementing the adders to dominate the resource utilization with moderate to low register usage. In the adder tree, the dominant operation is in the form of 𝑎 (𝑏 𝑠), where 𝑎and 𝑏are the variable inputs to the adder. The bit-shift 𝑠and the sign for the input 𝑏are known at compilation time. The expected cost of this operation is formulated as the number of full and half adders required to implement the operation (i.e., the number of output bits conditioned on more than one input).\n\n--- Segment 10 ---\nThe bit-shift 𝑠and the sign for the input 𝑏are known at compilation time. The expected cost of this operation is formulated as the number of full and half adders required to implement the operation (i.e., the number of output bits conditioned on more than one input). We denote the bitwidths for 𝑎and 𝑏as 𝑏𝑤𝑎and 𝑏𝑤𝑏, respectively. When there is at least one bit overlapping between the two operands (i.e., max(𝑏𝑤𝑎,𝑏𝑤𝑏) 𝑠), the simplified expected cost is given by cost(𝑏𝑤𝑎,𝑏𝑤𝑏,𝑠, sign) max(𝑏𝑤𝑎,𝑏𝑤𝑏 𝑠) min(0,𝑠) 1. (1) In practice, the logic delay of each adder with different input bitwidths will be different. However, as we notice that the majority of the delay in the adder trees is due to routing, we assume each adder to have the same delay and model the overall delay approximately by the adder depth for simplicity, following [3, 4, 16]. 3 da4ml Algorithm 3.1 Notations For a number of fixed-point type, it takes the general form of fixed 𝑆, 𝑊, 𝐼 , where 𝑆is the sign bit, 𝑊is the total bitwidth, and 𝐼is the number of integer bits including the sign bit. In the algorithm, we denote the fixed-point numbers by quantized interval, namely, by their low value, high value, and the step size, [𝑙,ℎ,𝛿]. For a generic fixed-point number in the form of fixed 𝑆, 𝑊, 𝐼 , we have 𝑙 𝑆 2(𝐼 𝑆), ℎ 2𝐼 𝑆 2 𝑊 𝐼, and 𝛿 2 𝑊 𝐼.\n\n--- Segment 11 ---\nIn the algorithm, we denote the fixed-point numbers by quantized interval, namely, by their low value, high value, and the step size, [𝑙,ℎ,𝛿].

This notation is useful to track the required bitwidths when accumulating a large number of fixed-point numbers, as otherwise one carry bit will always need to be added to prevent overflow. The notation we use in the algorithm is summarized in Table 1. In particular, 𝑀[𝑑𝑖𝑛,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡], 𝑞𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛[𝑑𝑖𝑛], 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑡[𝑑𝑖𝑛], and 𝑑𝑐are the input parameters to the algorithm for a single CMVM operation. 3.2 Overview The da4ml is a CSE-based hybrid algorithm. Like other CSE-based algorithms, the algorithm operates on a discrete representation of the constant matrix. In this work, following [3, 4, 9, 15], we adopt the canonical signed digit (CSD) [6] representation. CSD is a signed digit representation of a number that never has two consecutive non-zero digits, and the number of non-zero digits is guaranteed to be minimal. Hence, for a number with 𝑥digits, the CSD representation has at most 𝑥 2 1 non-zero digits, which is 1 3 of the total number of digits on average. As 𝑀contains only fixed-point integers, the algorithm first normalizes it by applying bit-shifts across the rows and columns such that no row column has all entries even except for zeros. The resultant scaling factors are recorded and will be applied to the input output vectors.\n\n--- Segment 12 ---\nAs 𝑀contains only fixed-point integers, the algorithm first normalizes it by applying bit-shifts across the rows and columns such that no row column has all entries even except for zeros.

Inspired by Hcmvm, we propose this stage to exploit the high-level similarity between the different columns of the constant matrix. For this purpose, we first let each column of 𝑀, 𝑀[:,𝑖] 𝑣𝑖(𝑖 [1, . . . ,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡]) be a vertex 𝑣𝑖in a graph. Then, we add the root vertex 𝑣0 associated with the zero vector 0 to the graph. The distance between two vertices 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑣𝑗is defined as the sum of the number of non-zero digits in the vector 𝑣𝑖 𝑣𝑗or 𝑣𝑖 𝑣𝑗, whichever is lower. Starting from 𝑣0 associated with 0, we use Prim s algorithm [31] to find an approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph, subject to a maximum depth smaller than or equal to 2𝑑𝑐from the root vertex. Each edge in the approximate MST is then translated back into a column vector in 𝑀1 of shape [𝑑𝑖𝑛,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡], with its contributions to the original outputs (-1, 0, or 1) recorded in the second submatrix 𝑀2 of shape [𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡]. The contribution can be determined by tracing from the root vertex to the corresponding vertex, where each edge traversed has a non-zero contribution.

𝑀2 constructed this way is usually significantly more sparse compared to 𝑀1. Both 𝑀1 and 𝑀2 are then passed to the next stage. This stage is useful for matrices with correlated columns and a high digit count. For matrices where the columns are rarely correlated, the algorithm would usually produce trivial decomposition, where 𝑀1 is a shuffled form of 𝑀and 𝑀2 is a shuffled identity matrix. As a realistic example would be too large for display, we show a minimal example of decomposing an matrix 𝑀of size 3 3: 𝑀 𝑣1 𝑣2 𝑣3 ª 0 1 3 1 2 4 2 3 5 ª (2) The graph constructed form this matrix is shown in Figure 2.

The corresponding column vectors to these edges are recorded in 𝑀1, and their contributions to 𝑣1, 𝑣2, and 𝑣3 are recorded in 𝑀2, where 𝑣1 is obtained by adding the first edge, 𝑣2 is obtained by adding the first two edges, and 𝑣3 is obtained by adding all three edges. 3.4 Second stage: Common Subexpression Elimination In the second stage, CSE is applied independently on 𝑀1 and 𝑀2, and the solutions are concatenated to form the final solution. For simplicity, we denote the input matrix for the second stage as just 𝑀. In this stage, 𝑀is again normalized into ˆ𝑀, which has no row or column containing all even numbers except for zeros.\n\n--- Segment 16 ---\nFor simplicity, we denote the input matrix for the second stage as just 𝑀. In this stage, 𝑀is again normalized into ˆ𝑀, which has no row or column containing all even numbers except for zeros. The algorithm then converts the input matrix to the CSD representation 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟 ( 1, 0, 1)𝑑𝑖𝑛,𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡,𝐵, where 𝐵is the span of the powers of the CSD digits (i.e., the difference between the minimal and maximal bit-shifts associated with the CSD digits plus one). The CSE algorithm starts with the 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟matrix, and a list of implemented values 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙initialized with the elements of the input vector: 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 [𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑑𝑖𝑛]. These two objects defines the state of the algorithm, and the algorithm updates the state iteratively until exhausting all common subexpressions. For each update step, the algorithm selects a two-term subexpression and implements it. A two-term subexpression is defined as an operation with the general form 𝑎 𝑏 𝑠, characterized as a four-tuple: the two inputs 𝑎and 𝑏, the sign, and the bit-shift 𝑠for the second operand2. 2The order of 𝑎and 𝑏is fixed by their location in the matrix in practice for the uniqueness of the four-tuple.

The root vertex 𝑣0 is on the bottom left.\n\n--- Segment 17 ---\nThe graph is constructed with Prim s algorithm, and the MST is shown in colored edges. The root vertex 𝑣0 is on the bottom left. The column vectors on the edges are the corresponding vectors that need to be added subtracted to transform between the two connected vertices. The number after the column vectors is the number of non-zero digits needed to represent the vector, and the smaller of the two is used as the edge weight. The column vectors corresponding to the edges in the MST are stored in 𝑀1, and their contributions to 𝑣1, 𝑣2, and 𝑣3 are recorded in 𝑀2. Implementing a two-term subexpression consists of two steps. The algorithm first appends the result of the two-term subexpression to the list of implemented values 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙. Then, it appends an empty row to 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟. For every occurrence of the subexpression in 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟, the algorithm sets the corresponding two digits to zero and sets -1 or 1 on the new row at the corresponding power. At all times, the value of Í 𝑗𝑣𝑗ˆ𝑀𝑗𝑖can be recovered with Í 𝑗,𝑠2𝑠 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙[𝑗] ˆ𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟[𝑗,𝑖,𝑠]. In the implementation, we keep a hash table that caches the frequency of all two-term subexpressions to speed up the optimization. While [3, 9] show that selecting the two-term subexpression that minimally conflicts with the other subexpressions could result in lower final adder usage, this approach requires a one-step look-ahead operation when selecting the two-term common subexpression in each update step, which involves a complexity of O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 2).\n\n--- Segment 18 ---\nIn the implementation, we keep a hash table that caches the frequency of all two-term subexpressions to speed up the optimization. While [3, 9] show that selecting the two-term subexpression that minimally conflicts with the other subexpressions could result in lower final adder usage, this approach requires a one-step look-ahead operation when selecting the two-term common subexpression in each update step, which involves a complexity of O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 2). Due to practical considerations for larger matrices, we instead select the most common subexpression to implement for each update step, which can be performed with a complexity of O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 ). As 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 is of the same order of magnitude as the total number of non-zero digits in 𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟, the additional time complexity for performing the look-ahead operation would be substantial. As suggested in [3], because this only improves the final resource utilization by less than 2 as measured in adder count, we decided that the additional complexity is not worth the runtime overhead. In contrast to [15], we also take into account the operands quantized intervals (i.e., the bitwidths and shift) when choosing the subexpression for each update step. As implied by the cost function in (1), it is preferred to have the two operands with similar bitwidths and shifts. However, directly weighting the frequency of the two-term subexpressions by the total cost is not ideal: it would also count the half-adders used, which are "overheads" as they may unnecessarily increase the accumulator width downstream. Instead, we weight the frequency by the number of overlapping bits between the two operands. This weighting reduces to a constant factor when the input bitwidths are uniform and significantly larger than the constant matrix s bitwidths. We show a minimal example of the second stage in Figure 3 with a constant matrix from the H.264 integer trans- form [42]. For presentation purposes, the matrix shown is a transposed matrix (i.e., 𝑦 𝑀 𝑥instead of 𝑦T 𝑥T𝑀).\n\n--- Segment 19 ---\nWe show a minimal example of the second stage in Figure 3 with a constant matrix from the H.264 integer trans- form [42].

Also, Manuscript submitted to ACM da4ml: Distributed Arithmetic for Real-time Neural Networks on FPGAs 9 please note that although the example matrix contains only power-of-two numbers, the algorithm accepts matrices with arbitrary fixed-point elements. The algorithm first identifies three two-term subexpressions, shown in the bounding boxes with the same color. In the first step, the expression 𝑥0 𝑥3 has the highest frequency and is implemented, and all of its occurrences are replaced. The algorithm then proceeds to implement the other two subexpressions.

Let 𝑁 𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑏𝑤𝑀. The complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the second stage. As the first stage is a constrained variation of the Prim s algorithm, the complexity of the first stage is bounded O(𝑑2 𝑜𝑢𝑡). For the second stage, we found that the complexity is dominated by optimizing 𝑀1, for which it is similar to optimizing 𝑀directly. Initializing the hash table requires a complexity of O 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑑𝑖𝑛 𝑏𝑤𝑀)2 for double iteration over the input dimensions and single iteration over the output expressions. O( 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙 ) O(𝑁) update steps are required to reach the final solution. For each step, the complexity is O(𝑁) to find the most common two-term subexpression over a cached dictionary. Each frequency update also takes O(𝑁) time, as only single iteration over the input dimensions is required for differential updates. Hence, the overall asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is expected to be O(𝑁2), dominated by the iterative update steps. In practice, we found the execution time of the algorithm to be asymptotically close to O(𝑁2 log(𝑁)2) up to 𝑁 105 (128 128 8-bit).

Designed for seamless deployment, the library is tightly integrated with the widely adopted hls4ml framework [12]. Users can easily enable da4ml by setting the strategy to distributed_arithmetic for any layer requiring CMVM operations, as shown in Listing 1. No further user configuration or intervention is required. The overall workflow is shown in Figure 5. In this workflow, da4ml generates an optimized adder tree for the CMVM operation in HLS C code, which is then used as a drop-in replacement for the default CMVM implementation within the hls4ml. This drop-in integration enables significant improvements in resource efficiency and latency without sacrificing usability. Currently, the Dense, EinsumDense, and Conv1D Conv2D layers are supported for the Vivado Vitis backends, with plans for broader support underway. By bridging algorithmic innovation with production-ready toolchains, da4ml provides a scalable and practical solution for deploying high-throughput, low-latency neural networks on FPGAs.\n\n--- Segment 23 ---\nCurrently, the Dense, EinsumDense, and Conv1D Conv2D layers are supported for the Vivado Vitis backends, with plans for broader support underway.

We then evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on realistic neural networks consisting CMVM operations. We perform both the HLS version and hardware-description-language (HDL) version of the algorithm. The HLS version is implemented with the hls4ml library [12], and the HDL version is implemented standalone with the da4ml library. 5.1 Random Matrices We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on random 𝑚 𝑚matrices.

Comparison of the da4ml algorithm with the Hcmvm algorithm on random matrices. In Table 2, we show the comparison of the da4ml algorithm with the Hcmvm algorithm on random matrices with 8-bits under different delay constraints. For each configuration, we report the adder depth (denoted as step ), total number of adders, and runtime on CPU. Results are shown for three delay constraint settings: no constraint, strict delay constraint (𝑑𝑐 0), and moderate delay constraint (𝑑𝑐 2). The CPU time is measured on a single thread of an Intel i7-13700 CPU for da4ml, and on a single thread of an Intel Xeon at 2.33 GHz for Hcmvm, as reported by the authors. The table shows the number of adders used in the optimized design of both algorithms under the same delay constraints, Manuscript submitted to ACM 12 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu and the adder depth (step) of both. When delay constraint is not exactly 0, the proposed algorithm has 2 overhead in adder counts compared to the Hcmvm algorithm. When strict delay constraint is required, the proposed algorithm has a larger overhead of 8 in adder counts. Please note that this slight trade-off in resource usage yields dramatic improvements in compilation speed. With respect to runtime, the da4ml algorithm is significantly more efficient, being O(100000) times faster than the Hcmvm algorithm with a moderate matrix size of 16 16.

Although there is a generation gap between the two CPU processors, the magnitude of the observed speedup far exceeds what can be attributed solely to CPU differences, highlighting the efficiency and scalability of our framework. We further show extended runtime results for larger matrices in Figure 6 the computation time of the da4ml algorithm on random matrices with up to 128 128 elements with 8 bits, as well as the time expected from the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm.

The target clock frequency is set to 160 MHz to match the previous work [36], and the delay constraint is set to 2 for each CMVM operation optimized. As the inputs of this network are all 1-bit, we do not apply da4ml to the initial convolutional layers, as they can be efficiently implemented using conditional accumulation logic. All implementations shown have an II of 1 clock cycle. Compared to the latency-optimized baseline from hls4ml, the da4ml-optimized designs not only reduce LUT utilization by approximately 10 but also entirely eliminate DSP usage. All designs met timing, while the latency- optimized designs in hls4ml are pipelined with more stages and have higher latency.

The particle-based jet tagging network [37] is an MLP Mixer based neural network for jet tagging. We adopt the architecture from [37] with the 64-particle input, and 16-features per particle. The network is trained with the HGQ library [10]. The architecture is shown in Figure 9. For this neural network, Vitis HLS 2023.2 cannot produce designs with II of 1 clock cycle when using the original hls4ml implementation. We suspect the issue is related to the multidimensional linear operation implemented with Einstein Summation templates, and some pragma usage used may be inappropriate. However, we do not investigate this issue further as it is beyond the scope of this work. The results are shown in Table 9. The designs are synthesized with Vitis HLS 2023.2 and Vivado 2023.2, with a target clock frequency set to 200 MHz and a target II of 1. The delay constraint is set to 2 for each optimized CMVM operation. Marginal resource savings are observed for these designs for LUTs.

The user defines the network in a functional style, and the code generation is performed with da4ml to generate synthesizable, pipelined Verilog code. 5.3 Standalone Code Generation Other than the main workflow introduced in Section 4, da4ml can also work standalone to generate Verilog designs for a subset of neural networks, allowing for easier integration into existing RTL workflows. Currently, the generated designs must be either fully pipelined with an II of 1 or combinational. In addition, da4ml only supports networks with generalized CMVM operations (i.e., including convolution and Einstein Summation between constants and inputs), arithmetic operations excluding division, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations for standalone code generation. In the current implementation, manually defining the network in a functional style is required, and the workflow is shown in Figure 10. Pipelining of the generated design is performed by layers of adders, in which each adder is assumed to have a constant latency. While this approximation is not accurate, we use it to simplify the pipelining process, as we notice that routing delay dominates the latency in most cases in our experiments and more complex modeling of the adders latency does not yield significant improvements. We also reserve an API for the user to specify the latency of each adder depending on the bitwidths of the operands.\n\n--- Segment 41 ---\nWhile this approximation is not accurate, we use it to simplify the pipelining process, as we notice that routing delay dominates the latency in most cases in our experiments and more complex modeling of the adders latency does not yield significant improvements.

In particular, it can be noticed that the designs generated in conjunction with hls4ml are Manuscript submitted to ACM 20 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu Implementation Accuracy Latency [cycles] LUT DSP FF Fmax [MHz] hls4ml DA 81.4 13 (62.6 ns) 125,694 0 26,097 207.6 da4ml 11 (54.8 ns) 120,512 0 28,284 200.8 hls4ml DA 81.0 13 (63.8 ns) 68,157 0 13,147 203.9 da4ml 11 (54.8 ns) 61,771 0 16,031 200.6 hls4ml DA 80.3 12 (56.9 ns) 50,657 0 11,411 210.9 da4ml 10 (48.4 ns) 47,778 0 12,515 206.8 hls4ml DA 77.3 11 (53.4 ns) 25,002 0 5,554 205.8 da4ml 9 (41.9 ns) 24,285 0 6,262 214.8 Table 12.

The FPGA part is xcvu13p-flga2577-2-e with 200 MHz target clock frequency. Delay constraint is set to 2 for the da4ml for each CMVM operation. The Verilog designs are pipelined every 5 adders. II is 1 for all designs shown. pipelined with more stages than the adder graph depth, which suggests that the HLS compiler is further breaking down the graph for timing optimization, a process not performed in the standalone code generation. We suspect this is the reason for the lower Fmax in the designs generated with da4ml. It is worth noting that designs generated with da4ml directly can significantly reduce compilation time: for designs with a large amount of code, HLS can take a very long time. For instance, the synthesis time for the particle-based jet tagging networks3 with Vitis HLS and Vivado 2023.2 is around 17 hours without memory bottleneck when optimized with da4ml. However, the designs of the same networks generated directly in Verilog with da4ml only take around 26 minutes to synthesize with Vivado 2023.2. The peak memory usage also significantly reduced from 70 GB to 10 GB. These results suggest that da4ml s standalone code generation can facilitate fast prototyping and allowing for faster iterations in software-hardware co-design. 5.4 Comparison to Other Methods While this work focuses on distributed arithmetic optimization for CMVM operations in FPGA-based neural networks, alternative methods exist for implementing machine learning-based models on FPGAs. In this section, we briefly compare neural networks optimized with da4ml to other methods. We show the comparasion in Table 13, where we compare the performance of the networks shown in earlier sections against other state-of-the-art methods. It is important to differentiate our approach from methods such as TreeLUT [18], NeuraLUT-Assemble [5], and DWN [7]. While da4ml optimizes the implementation of quantized traditional neural networks, these methods re- formulates the entire model into inherently hardware-native structures.\n\n--- Segment 46 ---\nIt is important to differentiate our approach from methods such as TreeLUT [18], NeuraLUT-Assemble [5], and DWN [7]. While da4ml optimizes the implementation of quantized traditional neural networks, these methods re- formulates the entire model into inherently hardware-native structures. In particular, TreeLUT defines the model as collection of quantized decision trees, while NeuraLUT-Assemble and DWN construct models directly mapped into LUTs with particular fan-in. These methods are highly specialized and may achieve exceptional efficiency in terms of resource utilization and throughput, while they often come at the cost of reduced generalizability and slight accuracy degradation. In contrast, da4ml focuses on optimizing the core CMVM operations of quantized, conventional neural networks, which would enable more straightforward integration with existing machine learning workflows and is applicable on more complex tasks.

Resource and performance of various neural network tasks with different implementations. When the neural network is quantized with HGQ [10], we show that traditional neural networks may achieve competitive resource utilization, throughput, and superior accuracy compared with the methods designed specifically for FPGAs. All works are using either xcvu13p-flga2577-2-e or xcvu9p-flgb2104-2-i, where the results are comparable. da4ml (HLS) refers to using da4ml with the hls4ml workflow, while da4ml (RTL) refers to the standalone workflow. Works marked with report the results after logic synthesis without place and route. We put the target clock frequency for Fmax and used it to compute the latency for these works. DWN results are cited from [5] instead, as the original paper omits preprocessing steps for the firmware implementation, which are added in [5] for a fair comparison. Works marked with reports resource utilization after place and routes, but did not report Fmax. We use the achieved target clock as Fmax for these works. traditional neural networks can achieve competitive resource utilization throughput - accuracy tradeoff compared to those methods highly co-designed for FPGAs.\n\n--- Segment 51 ---\nWe use the achieved target clock as Fmax for these works. traditional neural networks can achieve competitive resource utilization throughput - accuracy tradeoff compared to those methods highly co-designed for FPGAs. Comparing to other conventional neural network based methods shown in Table 13, our proposed da4ml framework demonstrates significant advantage across diverse workloads, offering a favorable balance between accuracy, latency, and hardware efficiency. Notably, our designs consistently eliminate DSP usage while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy, making them suited for resource-constrained FPGA designs. Similarly, in the muon tracking and SVHN classification tasks, our method matches the accuracy of existing approaches while reducing LUT and flip-flop utilization. Furthermore, the particle-based jet tagging design achieves the highest accuracy (81.4 ) while consuming more than 10 fewer LUTs and FFs than state-of-the-art GNN-based implementations. Across all tasks, our designs Manuscript submitted to ACM 22 Chang Sun, Zhiqiang Que, Vladimir Loncar, Wayne Luk, and Maria Spiropulu maintain a consistent II of 1 cycle, ensuring high-throughput operation. These results underscore the generalizability and practicality of our approach for low-latency, resource-efficient FPGA deployment in both traditional and physics-inspired neural networks. 6 Conclusion In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for optimizing CMVM operations with distributed arithmetic for FPGA- based neural networks. We further present the da4ml library, which implements the algorithm efficiently and tightly integrates it with the hls4ml library for easy adoption. We then demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of neural networks, including dense, convolutional, and MLP-Mixer-based networks. The results show that designs optimized with da4ml can simultaneously reduce resource utilization and timing on realistic, heavily quantized, and sparse neural networks for physics applications. We also show that for a limited set of networks, da4ml can generate Verilog designs directly for fast prototyping and software-hardware co-design. The results show that designs generated directly with da4ml could further reduce resource utilization and synthesis time significantly at the expense of a slightly lower Fmax. We hope this work will facilitate the design of efficient neural networks for FPGAs, especially in the context of physics applications, and provide a solid foundation for future work on hardware-aware neural network design.\n\n--- Segment 52 ---\nThe results show that designs generated directly with da4ml could further reduce resource utilization and synthesis time significantly at the expense of a slightly lower Fmax.
